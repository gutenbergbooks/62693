  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the following pages I have endeavoured to give a full and concise
    statement of the facts and arguments adduced in support of the theory
    of Secular Changes of the Earth’s Climate. Considerable portions of
    the volume have already appeared in substance as separate papers in
    the Philosophical Magazine and other journals during the past ten or
    twelve years. The theory, especially in as far as it relates to the
    cause of the glacial epoch, appears to be gradually gaining acceptance
    with geologists. This, doubtless, is owing to the greatly increased
    and constantly increasing knowledge of the drift-phenomena, which has
    induced the almost general conviction that a climate such as that of
    the glacial epoch could only have resulted from cosmical causes.</p>

  <p>Considerable attention has been devoted to objections, and to the
    removal of slight misapprehensions, which have naturally arisen in
    regard to a subject comparatively new and, in many respects, complex,
    and beset with formidable difficulties.</p>

  <p>I have studiously avoided introducing anything of a hypothetical
    character. All the conclusions are based either on known facts or
    admitted physical principles. In short, the aim of the work, as will be
    shown in the introductory chapter, is to prove that secular changes of
    climate follow, as a necessary effect, from admitted physical agencies,
    and that these changes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> in as far as the past climatic condition of
    the globe is concerned, fully meet the demand of the geologist.</p>

  <p>The volume, though not intended as a popular treatise, will be found,
    I trust, to be perfectly plain and intelligible even to readers not
    familiar with physical science.</p>

  <p>I avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my obligations to my
    colleagues, Mr. James Geikie, Mr. Robert L. Jack, Mr. Robert Etheridge,
    jun., and also to Mr. James Paton, of the Edinburgh Museum of Science
    and Art, for their valuable assistance rendered while these pages were
    passing through the press. To the kindness of Mr. James Bennie I am
    indebted for the copious index at the end of the volume, as well as
    for many of the facts relating to the glacial deposits of the West of
    Scotland.</p>

  <p><em>The Fundamental Problem of Geology.</em>—The investigation of the
    successive changes and modifications which the earth’s crust has
    undergone during past ages is the province of geology. It will be
    at once admitted that an acquaintance with the agencies by means of
    which those successive changes and modifications were effected, is of
    paramount importance to the geologist. What, then, are those agencies?
    Although volcanic and other subterranean eruptions, earthquakes,
    upheavals, and subsidences of the land have taken place in all ages,
    yet no truth is now better established than that it is not by these
    convulsions and cataclysms of nature that those great changes were
    effected. It was rather by the ordinary agencies that we see every day
    at work around us, such as rain, rivers, heat and cold, frost and snow.
    The valleys were not produced by violent dislocations, nor the hills
    by sudden upheavals, but were actually carved out of the solid rock,
    silently and gently, by the agencies to which we have referred. “The
    tools,” to quote the words of Professor Geikie, “by which this great
    work has been done are of the simplest and most every-day order—the
    air, rain, frosts, springs, brooks, rivers, glaciers, icebergs, and the
    sea. These tools have been at work from the earliest times of which
    any geological record has been preserved. Indeed, it is out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> the
    accumulated chips and dust which they have made, afterwards hardened
    into solid rock and upheaved, that the very framework of our continents
    has been formed.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>It will be observed—and this is the point requiring particular
    attention—that the agencies referred to are the ordinary meteorological
    or climatic agencies. In fact, it is these agencies which constitute
    climate. The various peculiarities or modifications of climate result
    from a preponderance of one or more of these agencies over the rest.
    When heat, for example, predominates, we have a hot or tropical
    climate. When cold and frost predominate, we have a rigorous or arctic
    climate. With moisture in excess, we have a damp and rainy climate;
    and so on. But this is not all. These climatic agencies are not only
    the factors which carved out the rocky face of the globe into hill
    and dale, and spread over the whole a mantle of soil; but by them are
    determined the character of the <i lang="la">flora</i> and <i lang="la">fauna</i> which exist on
    that soil. The flora and fauna of a district are determined mainly by
    the character of the climate, and not by the nature of the soil, or
    the conformation of the ground. It is from difference of climate that
    tropical life differs so much from arctic, and both these from the life
    of temperate regions. It is climate, and climate alone, that causes
    the orange and the vine to blossom, and the olive to flourish, in the
    south, but denies them to the north, of Europe. It is climate, and
    climate alone, that enables the forest tree to grow on the plain, but
    not on the mountain top; that causes wheat and barley to flourish on
    the mainland of Scotland, but not on the steppes of Siberia.</p>

  <p>Again, if we compare flat countries with mountainous, highlands with
    lowlands, or islands with continents, we shall find that difference of
    climatic conditions is the chief reason why life in the one differs
    so much from life in the other. And if we turn to the sea we find
    that organic life is there as much under the domain of climate as on
    the land, only the conditions are much less complex. For in the case
    of the sea, difference in the temperature of the water may be said
    to constitute almost the only <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>difference of climatic conditions.
    If there is one fact more clearly brought out than another by the
    recent deep-sea explorations, it is this, that nothing exercises so
    much influence on organic life in the ocean as the temperature of the
    water. In fact, so much is this the case, that warm zones were found
    to be almost equivalent to zones of life. It was found that even the
    enormous pressure at the bottom of the ocean does not exercise so much
    influence on life as the temperature of the water. There are few, I
    presume, who reflect on the subject that will not readily admit that,
    whether as regards the great physical changes which are taking place on
    the surface of our globe, or as regards the growth and distribution of
    plant and animal life, the ordinary climatic agents are the real agents
    at work, and that, compared with them, all other agencies sink into
    insignificance.</p>

  <p>It will also be admitted that what holds true of the present holds
    equally true of the past. Climatic agents are not only now the most
    important and influential; they have been so during all past geological
    ages. They were so during the Cainozoic as much as during the present;
    and there is no reason for supposing they were otherwise during the
    remoter Mesozoic and Palæozoic epochs. They have been the principal
    factors concerned in that long succession of events and changes which
    have taken place since the time of the solidification of the earth’s
    crust. The stratified rocks of the globe contain all the records which
    now remain of their action, and it is the special duty of the geologist
    to investigate and read those records. It will be at once admitted that
    in order to a proper understanding of the events embodied in these
    records, an acquaintance with the agencies by which they were produced
    is of the utmost importance. In fact, it is only by this means that we
    can hope to arrive at their rational explanation. A knowledge of the
    agents, and of the laws of their operations, is, in all the physical
    sciences, the means by which we arrive at a rational comprehension
    of the effects produced. If we have before us some complex and
    intricate effects which have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> produced by heat, or by light, or by
    electricity, &amp;c., in order to understand them we must make ourselves
    acquainted with the agents by which they were produced and the laws of
    their action. If the effects to be considered be, for example, those of
    heat, then we must make ourselves acquainted with this agent and its
    laws. If they be of electricity, then a knowledge of electricity and
    its laws becomes requisite.</p>

  <p>This is no mere arbitrary mode of procedure which may be adopted in
    one science and rejected in another. It is in reality a necessity of
    thought arising out of the very constitution of our intellect; for the
    objective law of the agent is the conception by means of which the
    effects are subjectively united in a rational unity. We may describe,
    arrange, and classify the effects as we may, but without a knowledge of
    the laws of the agent we can have no rational unity. We have not got
    the higher conception by which they can be <em>comprehended</em>. It is this
    relationship between the effects and the laws of the agent, a knowledge
    of which really constitutes a science. We might examine, arrange, and
    describe for a thousand years the effects produced by heat, and still
    we should have no science of heat unless we had a knowledge of the
    laws of that agent. The effects would never be seen to be necessarily
    connected with anything known to us; we could not connect them with
    any rational principle from which they could be deduced <i lang="la">à priori</i>.
    The same remarks hold, of course, equally true of all sciences, in
    which the things to be considered stand in the relationship of cause
    and effect. Geology is no exception. It is not like systematic botany,
    a mere science of classification. It has to explain and account for
    effects produced; and these effects can no more be explained without
    a knowledge of the laws of the agents which produced them, than can
    the effects of heat without a knowledge of the laws of heat. The only
    distinction between geology and heat, light, electricity, &amp;c., is,
    that in geology the effects to be explained have almost all occurred
    already, whereas in these other sciences effects actually taking place
    have to be explained. But this distinction is of no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> importance to
    our present purpose, for effects which have already occurred can no
    more be explained without a knowledge of the laws of the agent which
    produced them than can effects which are in the act of occurring. It
    is, moreover, not strictly true that all the effects to be explained
    by the geologist are already past. It falls within the scope of his
    science to account for the changes which are at present taking place on
    the earth’s crust.</p>

  <p>No amount of description, arrangement, and classification, however
    perfect or accurate, of the facts which come under the eye of the
    geologist can ever constitute a science of geology any more than a
    description and classification of the effects of heat could constitute
    a science of heat. This will, no doubt, be admitted by every one who
    reflects upon the subject, and it will be maintained that geology,
    like every other science, must possess principles applicable to the
    facts. But here confusion and misconception will arise unless there be
    distinct and definite ideas as to what ought to constitute a geological
    principle. It is not every statement or rule that may apply to a great
    many facts, which will constitute a geological principle. A geological
    principle must bear the same characteristics as the principles of those
    sciences to which we have referred. What, then, is the nature of the
    principles of light, heat, electricity, &amp;c.? The principles of heat
    are the laws of heat. The principles of electricity are the laws of
    electricity. And these laws are nothing more nor less than the ways
    according to which these agents produce their effects. The principles
    of geology are therefore the laws of geology. But the laws of geology
    must be simply the laws of the geological agents, or, in other words,
    the methods by which they produce their effects. Any other so-called
    principle can be nothing more than an empirical rule, adopted for
    convenience. Possessing no rationality in itself, it cannot be justly
    regarded as a principle. In order to rationality the principle must be
    either resolvable into, or logically deducible from, the laws of the
    agents. Unless it possess this quality we cannot give the explanation
    <i lang="la">à priori</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p>The reason of all this is perfectly obvious. The things to be explained
    are effects; and the relationship between cause and effect affords the
    subjective connection between the principle and the explanation. The
    explanation follows from the principle simply as the effect results
    from the laws of the agent or cause.</p>

  <p><em>Theories of Geological Climate.</em>—We have already seen that the
    geological agents are chiefly the ordinary climatic agents.
    Consequently, the main principles of geology must be the laws of the
    climatic agents, or some logical deductions from them. It therefore
    follows that, in order to a purely scientific geology, the grand
    problem must be one of geological climate. It is through geological
    climate that we can hope to arrive ultimately at principles which will
    afford a rational explanation of the multifarious facts which have
    been accumulating during the past century. The facts of geology are
    as essential to the establishment of the principles, as the facts of
    heat, light, and electricity are essential to the establishment of the
    principles of these sciences. A theory of geological climate devised
    without reference to the facts would be about as worthless as a theory
    of heat or of electricity devised without reference to the facts of
    these sciences.</p>

  <p>It has all along been an admitted opinion among geologists that the
    climatic condition of our globe has not, during past ages, been
    uniformly the same as at present. For a long time it was supposed that
    during the Cambrian, Silurian, and other early geological periods, the
    climate of our globe was much hotter than now, and that ever since
    it has been gradually becoming cooler. And this high temperature of
    Palæozoic ages was generally referred to the influence of the earth’s
    internal heat. It has, however, been proved by Sir William Thomson<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    that the general climate of our globe could not have been sensibly
    affected by internal heat at any time more than ten thousand years
    after the commencement of the solidification of the surface. This
    physicist has proved that the present influence of internal heat on
    the temperature amounts to about only 1/75th of a degree. Not only
    is the theory of internal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>heat now generally abandoned, but it is
    admitted that we have no good geological evidence that climate was much
    hotter during Palæozoic ages than now; and much less, that it has been
    becoming <em>uniformly</em> colder.</p>

  <p>The great discovery of the glacial epoch, and more lately that of a
    mild and temperate condition of climate extending during the Miocene
    and other periods to North Greenland, have introduced a complete
    revolution of ideas in reference to geological climate. Those
    discoveries showed that our globe has not only undergone changes of
    climate, but changes of the most extraordinary character. They showed
    that at one time not only an arctic condition of climate prevailed in
    our island, but that the greater part of the temperate region down
    to comparatively low latitudes was buried under ice, while at other
    periods Greenland and the Arctic regions, probably up to the North
    Pole, were not only free from ice, but were covered with a rich and
    luxuriant vegetation.</p>

  <p>To account for these extraordinary changes of climate has generally
    been regarded as the most difficult and perplexing problem which has
    fallen to the lot of the geologist. Some have attempted to explain
    them by assuming a displacement of the earth’s axis of rotation in
    consequence of the uprising of large mountain masses on some part
    of the earth’s surface. But it has been shown by Professor Airy,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    Sir William Thomson,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and others, that the earth’s equatorial
    protuberance is such that no geological change on its surface could
    ever possibly alter the position of the axis of rotation to an extent
    which could at all sensibly affect climate. Others, again, have tried
    to explain the change of climate by supposing, with Poisson, that the
    earth during its past geological history may have passed through hotter
    and colder parts of space. This is not a very satisfactory hypothesis.
    There is no doubt a difference in the quantity of force in the form of
    heat passing through different parts of space; but space itself is not
    a substance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>which can possibly be either cold or hot. If, therefore,
    we were to adopt this hypothesis, we must assume that the earth during
    the hot periods must have been in the vicinity of some other great
    source of heat and light besides the sun. But the proximity of a
    mass of such magnitude as would be sufficient to affect to any great
    extent the earth’s climate would, by its gravity, seriously disarrange
    the mechanism of our solar system. Consequently, if our solar system
    had ever, during any former period of its history, really come into
    the vicinity of such a mass, the orbits of the planets ought at the
    present day to afford some evidence of it. But again, in order to
    account for a cold period, such as the glacial epoch, we have to assume
    that the earth must have come into the vicinity of a cold body.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
    But recent discoveries in regard to inter-glacial periods are wholly
    irreconcilable with this theory.</p>

  <p>A change in the obliquity of the ecliptic has frequently been, and
    still is, appealed to as an explanation of geological climate. This
    theory appears, however, to be beset by a twofold objection: (1), it
    can be shown from celestial mechanics, that the variations in the
    obliquity of the ecliptic must always have been so small that they
    could not materially affect the climatic condition of the globe; and
    (2), even admitting that the obliquity could change to an indefinite
    extent, it can be shown<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that no increase or decrease, however great,
    could possibly account for either the glacial epoch or a warm temperate
    condition of climate in polar regions.</p>

  <p>The theory that the sun is a variable star, and that the glacial
    epochs of the geologists may correspond to periods of decrease in the
    sun’s heat, has lately been advanced. This theory is also open to two
    objections: (1), a general diminution of heat<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> never could produce
    a glacial epoch; and (2), even if it could, it would not explain
    inter-glacial periods.</p>

  <p>The only other theory on the subject worthy of notice is that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
    of Sir Charles Lyell. Those extraordinary changes of climate are,
    according to his theory, attributed to differences in the distribution
    of land and water. Sir Charles concludes that, were the land all
    collected round the poles, while the equatorial zones were occupied by
    the ocean, the general temperature would be lowered to an extent that
    would account for the glacial epoch. And, on the other hand, were the
    land all collected along the equator, while the polar regions were
    covered with sea, this would raise the temperature of the globe to an
    enormous extent. It will be shown in subsequent chapters that this
    theory does not duly take into account the prodigious influence exerted
    on climate by means of the heat conveyed from equatorial to temperate
    and polar regions by means of ocean-currents. In Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_II">II.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III.</a>
    I have endeavoured to prove (1), that were it not for the heat conveyed
    from equatorial to temperate and polar regions by this means, the
    thermal condition of the globe would be totally different from what it
    is at present; and (2), that the effect of placing all the land along
    the equator would be diametrically the opposite of that which Sir
    Charles supposes.</p>

  <p>But supposing that difference in the distribution of land and water
    would produce the effects attributed to it, nevertheless it would not
    account for those extraordinary changes of climate which have occurred
    during geological epochs. Take, for example, the glacial epoch.
    Geologists almost all agree that little or no change has taken place
    in the relative distribution of sea and land since that <em>epoch</em>. All
    our main continents and islands not only existed then as they do now,
    but every year is adding to the amount of evidence which goes to show
    that so recent, geologically considered, is the glacial epoch that the
    very contour of the surface was pretty much the same then as it is at
    the present day. But this is not all; for even should we assume (1),
    that a difference in the distribution of sea and land would produce the
    effects referred to, and (2), that we had good geological evidence to
    show that at a very recent period a form of distribution existed which
    would produce the necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> glacial conditions, still the glacial
    epoch would not be explained, for the phenomena of warm inter-glacial
    periods would completely upset the theory.</p>

  <p><em>Geological Climate depending on Astronomical Causes.</em>—For a good many
    years past, an impression has been gradually gaining ground amongst
    geologists that the glacial epoch, as well as the extraordinary
    condition of climate which prevailed in arctic regions during the
    Miocene and other periods, must some way or other have resulted from
    a cosmical cause; but all seemed at a loss to conjecture what that
    cause could possibly be. It was apparent that the cosmical cause must
    be sought for in the relations of our earth to the sun; but a change
    in the obliquity of the ecliptic and the eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit are the only changes from which any sensible effect on climate
    could possibly be expected to result. It was shown, however, by Laplace
    that the change of obliquity was confined within so narrow limits that
    it has scarcely ever been appealed to as a cause seriously affecting
    climate. The only remaining cause to which appeal could be made was
    the change in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit—precession of the
    equinoxes without eccentricity producing, of course, no effect whatever
    on climate. Upwards of forty years ago Sir John Herschel and a few
    other astronomers directed their attention to the consideration of this
    cause, but the result arrived at was adverse to the supposition that
    change of eccentricity could greatly affect the climate of our globe.</p>

  <p>As some misapprehension seems to prevail with reference to this, I
    would take the liberty of briefly adverting to the history of the
    matter,—referring the reader to the Appendix for fuller details.</p>

  <p>About the beginning of the century some writers attributed the lower
    temperature of the southern hemisphere to the fact that the sun remains
    about seven days less on that hemisphere than on the northern; their
    view being that the southern hemisphere on this account receives
    seven days less heat than the northern. Sir Charles Lyell, in the
    first edition of his “Principles,” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>published in 1830, refers to this
    as a cause which might produce some slight effect on climate. Sir
    Charles’s remarks seem to have directed Sir John Herschel’s attention
    to the subject, for in the latter part of the same year he read a
    paper before the Geological Society on the astronomical causes which
    may influence geological phenomena, in which, after pointing out the
    mistake into which Sir Charles had been led in concluding that the
    southern hemisphere receives less heat than the northern, he considers
    the question as to whether geological climate could be influenced by
    changes in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. He did not appear at
    the time to have been aware of the conclusions arrived at by Lagrange
    regarding the superior limit of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit;
    but he came to the conclusion that possibly the climate of our globe
    may have been affected by variations in the eccentricity of its orbit.
    “An amount of variation,” he says, “which we need not hesitate to
    admit (at least provisionally) as a possible one, may be productive
    of considerable diversity of climate, and may operate during great
    periods of time either to mitigate or to exaggerate the difference of
    winter and summer temperatures, so as to produce alternately in the
    same latitude of either hemisphere a perpetual spring, or the extreme
    vicissitudes of a burning summer and a rigorous winter.”</p>

  <p>This opinion, however, was unfortunately to a great extent nullified
    by the statement which shortly afterwards appeared in his “Treatise
    on Astronomy,” and also in the “Outlines of Astronomy,” to the effect
    that the elliptic form of the earth’s orbit has but a very trifling
    influence in producing variation of temperature corresponding to the
    sun’s distance; the reason being that whatever may be the ellipticity
    of the orbit, it follows that equal amounts of heat are received
    from the sun in passing over equal angles round it, in whatever part
    of the ellipse those angles may be situated. Those angles will of
    course be described in unequal times, but the greater proximity of
    the sun exactly compensates for the more rapid description, and thus
    an equilibrium of heat is maintained. The sun, for example, is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> much
    nearer the earth when he is over the southern hemisphere than he is
    when over the northern; but the southern hemisphere does not on this
    account receive more heat than the northern; for, owing to the greater
    velocity of the earth when nearest the sun, the sun does not remain
    so long on the southern hemisphere as he does on the northern. These
    two effects so exactly counterbalance each other that, whatever be
    the extent of the eccentricity, the total amount of heat reaching
    both hemispheres is the same. And he considered that this beautiful
    compensating principle would protect the climate of our globe from
    being seriously affected by an increase in the eccentricity of its
    orbit, unless the extent of that increase was very great.</p>

  <p>“Were it not,” he says, “for this, the eccentricity of the orbit
    would materially influence the transition of seasons. The fluctuation
    of distance amounts to nearly 1/30th of its mean quantity, and
    consequently the fluctuation in the sun’s direct heating power to
    double this, or 1/15th of the whole. Now the perihelion of the orbit is
    situated nearly at the place of the northern winter solstice; so that,
    were it not for the compensation we have just described, the effect
    would be to exaggerate the difference of summer and winter in the
    southern hemisphere, and to moderate it in the northern; thus producing
    a more violent alternation of climate in the one hemisphere, and an
    approach to perpetual spring in the other. As it is, however, no such
    inequality subsists, but an equal and impartial distribution of heat
    and light is accorded to both.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>Herschel’s opinion was shortly afterwards adopted and advocated by
    Arago<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and by Humboldt.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>Arago, for example, states that so little is the climate of our globe
    affected by the eccentricity of its orbit, that even were the orbit to
    become as eccentric as that of the planet Pallas (that is, as great as
    0·24), “still this would not alter in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>any appreciable manner the mean
    thermometrical state of the globe.”</p>

  <p>This idea, supported by these great authorities, got possession of the
    public mind; and ever since it has been almost universally regarded
    as settled that the great changes of climate indicated by geological
    phenomena could not have resulted from any change in the relation of
    the earth to the sun.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one effect that was not regarded as compensated. The
    total amount of heat received by the earth is inversely proportional
    to the minor axis of its orbit; and it follows, therefore, that the
    greater the eccentricity, the greater is the total amount of heat
    received by the earth. On this account it was concluded that an
    increase of eccentricity would tend to a certain extent to produce a
    warmer climate.</p>

  <p>All those conclusions to which I refer, arrived at by astronomers, are
    perfectly legitimate so far as the direct effects of eccentricity are
    concerned; and it was quite natural, and, in fact, proper to conclude
    that there was nothing in the mere increase of eccentricity that could
    produce a glacial epoch. How unnatural would it have been to have
    concluded that an increase in the quantity of heat received from the
    sun should lower the temperature, and cover the country with snow and
    ice! Neither would excessively cold winters, followed by excessively
    hot summers, produce a glacial epoch. To assert, therefore, that the
    purely astronomical causes could produce such an effect would be simply
    absurd.</p>

  <p><em>Important Consideration overlooked.</em>—The important fact, however, was
    overlooked that, although the glacial epoch could not result <em>directly</em>
    from an increase of eccentricity, it might nevertheless do so
    <em>indirectly</em>. Although an increase of eccentricity could have no direct
    tendency to lower the temperature and cover our country with ice, yet
    it might bring into operation physical agents which would produce this
    effect.</p>

  <p>If, instead of endeavouring to trace a direct connection between a high
    condition of eccentricity and a glacial condition of climate, we turn
    our attention to the consideration of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> are the physical effects
    which result from an increase of eccentricity, we shall find that a
    host of physical agencies are brought into operation, the combined
    effect of which is to lower to a very great extent the temperature of
    the hemisphere whose winters occur in aphelion, and to raise to nearly
    as great an extent the temperature of the opposite hemisphere, whose
    winters of course occur in perihelion. Until attention was directed to
    those physical circumstances to which I refer, it was impossible that
    the true cause of the glacial epoch could have been discovered; and,
    moreover, many of the indirect and physical effects, which in reality
    were those that brought about the glacial epoch, could not, in the
    nature of things, have been known previously to recent discoveries in
    the science of heat.</p>

  <p>The consideration and discussion of those various physical agencies are
    the chief aim of the following pages.</p>

  <p><em>Abstract of the Line of Argument pursued in this Volume.</em>—I shall
    now proceed to give a brief abstract of the line of argument pursued
    in this volume. But as a considerable portion of it is devoted to the
    consideration of objections and difficulties bearing either directly
    or indirectly on the theory, it will be necessary to point out what
    those difficulties are, how they arose, and the methods which have been
    adopted to overcome them.</p>

  <p><a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a> contains an outline of the physical agencies affecting
    climate which are brought into operation by an increase of
    eccentricity. By far the most important of all those agencies, and the
    one which mainly brought about the glacial epoch, is the <em>Deflection</em>
    of Ocean-Currents. The consideration of the indirect physical
    connection between a high state of eccentricity and the deflection
    of ocean-currents, and also the enormous influence on climate which
    results from this deflection constitute not only the most important
    part of the subject, but the one beset with the greatest amount of
    difficulties.</p>

  <p>The difficulties besetting this part of the theory arise mainly from
    the imperfect state of our knowledge, (1st) with reference
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> to the
    absolute amount of heat transferred from equatorial to temperate and
    polar regions by means of ocean-currents and the influence which the
    heat thus transferred has on the distribution of temperature on the
    earth’s surface; and (2nd) in connection with the physical cause of
    ocean circulation.</p>

  <p>In Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_II">II.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III.</a> I have entered at considerable length into
    the consideration of the effects of ocean currents on the distribution
    of heat over the globe. The only current of which anything like
    an accurate estimate of volume and temperature has been made is
    the Gulf-stream. In reference to this stream we have a means of
    determining in absolute measure the quantity of heat conveyed by it.
    On the necessary computation being made, it is found that the amount
    transferred by the Gulf-stream from equatorial regions into the North
    Atlantic is enormously greater than was ever anticipated, amounting
    to no less than one-fifth part of the entire heat possessed by the
    North Atlantic. This striking fact casts a new light on the question
    of the distribution of heat over the globe. It will be seen that to
    such an extent is the temperature of the equatorial regions lowered,
    and that of high temperate, and polar regions raised, by means of ocean
    currents, that were they to cease, and each latitude to depend solely
    on the heat received directly from the sun, only a very small portion
    of the globe would be habitable by the present order of beings. This
    being the case, it becomes obvious to what an extent the deflection
    of ocean currents must affect temperature. For example, were the
    Gulf-stream stopped, and the heat conveyed by it deflected into the
    Southern Ocean, how enormously would this tend to lower the temperature
    of the northern hemisphere, and raise the temperature south of the
    equator.</p>

  <p>Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X.</a>, and <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">XIII.</a>, are devoted to the
    consideration of the physical cause of oceanic circulation. This has
    been found to be the most difficult and perplexing part of the whole
    inquiry. The difficulties mainly arise from the great diversity of
    opinion and confusion of ideas prevailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> in regard to the mechanics
    of the subject. There are two theories propounded to account for
    oceanic circulation; the one which may be called the <em>Wind</em> theory, and
    the other the <em>Gravitation</em> theory; and this diversity of opinion and
    confusion of ideas prevail in connection with both theories. As the
    question of the cause of oceanic circulation has not only a direct and
    important bearing on the subject of the present volume, but is further
    one of much general interest, I have entered somewhat fully into the
    matter.</p>

  <p>The Gravitation theories may be divided into two classes. The first of
    these attributes the Gulf-stream and other sensible currents of the
    ocean to difference of specific gravity, resulting from difference
    of temperature between the sea in equatorial and polar regions. The
    leading advocate of this theory was the late Lieutenant Maury, who
    brought it so much into prominence in his interesting book on the
    “Physical Geography of the Sea.” The other class does not admit that
    the sensible currents of the ocean can be produced by difference of
    specific gravity; but they maintain that difference of temperature
    between the sea in equatorial and polar regions produces a general
    movement of the upper portion of the sea from the equator to the
    poles, and a counter-movement of the under portion from the poles
    to the equator. This form of the gravitation theory has been ably
    and zealously advocated by Dr. Carpenter, who may be regarded as
    its representative. The Wind theories also divide into two classes.
    According to the one ocean currents are caused and maintained by the
    impulse of the trade-winds, while according to the other they are
    due not to the impulse of the trade-winds alone, but to that of the
    prevailing winds of the globe, regarded as a general system. The former
    of these is the one generally accepted; the latter is that advocated in
    the present volume.</p>

  <p>The relations which these theories bear to the question of secular
    change of climate, will be found stated at length in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI.</a> It
    will, however, be better to state here in a few words what those
    relations are. When the eccentricity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> earth’s orbit attains a
    high value, the hemisphere, whose winter solstice occurs in aphelion,
    has, for reasons which are explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>, its temperature
    lowered, while that of the opposite hemisphere is raised. Let us
    suppose the northern hemisphere to be the cold one, and the southern
    the warm one. The difference of temperature between the equator and
    the North Pole will then be greater than between the equator and the
    South Pole; according, therefore, to theory, the trades of the northern
    hemisphere will be stronger than those of the southern, and will
    consequently blow across the equator to some distance on the southern
    hemisphere. This state of things will tend to deflect equatorial
    currents southwards, impelling the warm water of the equatorial regions
    more into the southern or warm hemisphere than into the northern or
    cold hemisphere. The tendency of all this will be to exaggerate the
    difference of temperature already existing between the two hemispheres.
    If, on the other hand, the great ocean currents which convey the warm
    equatorial waters to temperate and polar regions be not produced by
    the impulse of the winds, but by difference of temperature, as Maury
    maintains, then in the case above supposed the equatorial waters would
    be deflected more into the northern or cold hemisphere than into the
    southern or warm hemisphere, because the difference of temperature
    between the equator and the poles would be greater on the cold than
    on the warm hemisphere. This, of course, would tend to neutralize or
    counteract that difference of temperature between the two hemispheres
    which had been previously produced by eccentricity. In short, this
    theory of circulation would effectually prevent eccentricity from
    seriously affecting climate.</p>

  <p>Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII.</a> have been devoted to an examination of this form
    of the gravitation theory.</p>

  <p>The above remarks apply equally to Dr. Carpenter’s form of the theory;
    for according to a doctrine of General Oceanic Circulation resulting
    from difference of specific gravity between the water at the equator
    and at the poles, the equatorial water will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> be carried more to the
    cold than to the warm hemisphere. It is perfectly true that a belief
    in a general oceanic circulation may be held quite consistently with
    the theory of secular changes of climate, provided it be admitted
    that not this general circulation but ocean currents are the great
    agency employed in distributing heat over the globe. The advocates of
    the theory, however, admit no such thing, but regard ocean currents
    as of secondary importance. It may be stated that the existence of
    this general ocean circulation has never been detected by actual
    observation. It is simply assumed in order to account for certain
    facts, and it is asserted that such a circulation must take place as
    a physical necessity. I freely admit that were it not that the warm
    water of equatorial regions is being constantly carried off by means
    of ocean currents such as the Gulf-stream, it would accumulate till,
    in order to restoration of equilibrium, such a general movement as is
    supposed would be generated. But it will be shown that the warm water
    in equatorial regions is being drained off so rapidly by ocean currents
    that the actual density of an equatorial column differs so little
    from that of a polar column that the force of gravity resulting from
    that difference is so infinitesimal that it is doubtful whether it is
    sufficient to produce sensible motion. I have also shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter
    VIII.</a> that all the facts which this theory is designed to explain are
    not only explained by the wind theory, but are deducible from it as
    necessary consequences. In <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI.</a> it is proved, by contrasting
    the quantity of heat conveyed by ocean currents from inter-tropical to
    temperate and polar regions with such an amount as could possibly be
    conveyed by means of a general oceanic circulation, that the latter
    sinks into insignificance before the former. In Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">XII.</a>
    the various objections which have been advanced by Dr. Carpenter and
    Mr. Findlay are discussed at considerable length, and in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX.</a>
    I have entered somewhat minutely into an examination of the mechanics
    of the gravitation theory. A statement of the wind theory is given in
    <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII.</a>; and in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV.</a> is shown the relation of this theory
    to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> theory of Secular changes of climate. This terminates the part
    of the inquiry relating to oceanic circulation.</p>

  <p>We now come to the <em>crucial test</em> of the theories respecting the cause
    of the glacial epoch, viz., Warm Inter-glacial Periods. In Chapters
    <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">XV.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">XVI.</a> I have given a statement of the geological facts which
    go to prove that that long epoch known as the Glacial was not one
    of continuous cold, but consisted of a succession of cold and warm
    periods. This condition of things is utterly inexplicable on every
    theory of the cause of the glacial epoch which has hitherto been
    advanced; but, according to the physical theory of secular changes of
    climate under consideration, it follows as a necessary consequence.
    In fact, the amount of geological evidence which has already been
    accumulated in reference to inter-glacial periods may now be regarded
    as perfectly sufficient to establish the truth of that theory.</p>

  <p>If the glacial epoch resulted from some accidental distribution of sea
    and land, then there may or may not have been more than one glacial
    epoch, but if it resulted from the cause which we have assigned, then
    there must have been during the geological history of the globe a
    succession of glacial epochs corresponding to the secular variations
    in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. A belief in the existence
    of recurring glacial epochs has been steadily gaining ground for many
    years past. I have, in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII.</a>, given at some length the facts
    on which this belief rests. It is true that the geological evidence of
    glacial epochs in prior ages is meagre in comparison with that of the
    glacial epoch of Post-tertiary times; but there is a reason for this in
    the nature of geological evidence itself. <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter XVII.</a> deals with the
    geological records of former glacial epochs, showing that they are not
    only imperfect, but that there is good reason why they should be so,
    and that the imperfection of the records in reference to them cannot be
    advanced as an argument against their existence.</p>

  <p>If the glacial epoch resulted from a high condition of eccentricity, we
    have not only a means of determining the positive date of that epoch,
    but we have also a means of determining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> geological time in absolute
    measure. For if the glacial epochs of prior ages correspond to periods
    of high eccentricity, then the intervals between those periods of high
    eccentricity become the measure of the intervals between the glacial
    epochs. The researches of Lagrange and Leverrier into the secular
    variations of the elements of the orbits of the planets enable us
    to determine with tolerable accuracy the values of the eccentricity
    of the earth’s orbit for, at least, four millions of years past and
    future. With the view of determining those values, I several years
    ago computed from Leverrier’s formula the eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit and longitude of the perihelion, at intervals of ten thousand and
    fifty thousand years during a period of three millions of years in the
    past, and one million of years in the future. The tables containing
    these values will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX.</a> These tables not only give
    us the date of the glacial epoch, but they afford, as will be seen
    from <a href="#CHAPTER_XXI">Chapter XXI.</a>, evidence as to the probable date of the Eocene and
    Miocene periods.</p>

  <p>Ten years ago, when the theory was first advanced, it was beset by
    a very formidable difficulty, arising from the opinions which then
    prevailed in reference to geological time. One or two glacial epochs in
    the course of a million of years was a conclusion which at that time
    scarcely any geologist would admit, and most would have felt inclined
    to have placed the last glacial epoch at least one million of years
    back. But then if we assume that the glacial epoch was due to a high
    state of eccentricity, we should be compelled to admit of at least two
    glacial epochs during that lapse of time. It was the modern doctrine
    that the great changes undergone by the earth’s crust were produced,
    not by convulsions of nature, but by the slow and almost imperceptible
    action, of rain, rivers, snow, frost, ice, &amp;c., which impressed so
    strongly on the mind of the geologist the vast duration of geological
    periods. When it was considered that the rocky face of our globe had
    been carved into hills and dales, and ultimately worn down to the
    sea-level by means of those apparently trifling agents, not only once
    or twice, but many times, during past ages, it was not surprising
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> that
    the views entertained by geologists regarding the immense antiquity of
    our globe should not have harmonised with the deductions of physical
    science on the subject. It had been shown by Sir William Thomson and
    others, from physical considerations relating to the age of the sun’s
    heat and the secular cooling of our globe, that the geological history
    of our earth’s crust must be limited to a period of something like
    one hundred millions of years. But these speculations had but little
    weight when pitted against the stern and undeniable facts of subaërial
    denudation. How, then, were the two to be reconciled? Was it the
    physicist who had under-estimated geological time, or the geologist
    who had over-estimated it? Few familiar with modern physics, and who
    have given special attention to the subject, would admit that the sun
    could have been dissipating his heat at the present enormous rate for
    a period much beyond one hundred millions of years. The probability
    was that the amount of work performed on the earth’s crust by the
    denuding agents in a period so immense as a million of years was, for
    reasons stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">Chapter XX.</a>, very much under-estimated. But the
    difficulty was how to prove this. How was it possible to measure the
    rate of operation of agents so numerous and diversified acting with
    such extreme slowness and irregularity over so immense areas? In other
    words, how was it possible to measure the rate of subaërial denudation?
    Pondering over this problem about ten years ago, an extremely simple
    and obvious method of solving it suggested itself to my mind. This
    method—the details of which will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">Chapter XX.</a>—showed that
    the rate of subaërial denudation is enormously greater than had been
    supposed. The method is now pretty generally accepted, and the result
    has already been to bring about a complete reconciliation between
    physics and geology in reference to time.</p>

  <p><a href="#CHAPTER_XXI">Chapter XXI.</a> contains an account of the gravitation theories of the
    origin of the sun’s heat. The energy possessed by the sun is generally
    supposed to have been derived from gravitation, combustion being
    totally inadequate as a source. But something more than gravitation
    is required before we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> account for even one hundred millions of
    years’ heat. Gravitation could not supply even one-half that amount.
    There must be some other and greater source than that of gravitation.
    There is, however, as is indicated, an obvious source from which far
    more energy may have been derived than could have been obtained from
    gravitation.</p>

  <p>The method of determining the rate of subaërial denudation enables us
    also to arrive at a rough estimate of the actual mean thickness of the
    stratified rocks of the globe. It will be seen from <a href="#CHAPTER_XXII">Chapter XXII.</a> that
    the mean thickness is far less than is generally supposed.</p>

  <p>The physical cause of the submergence of the land during the glacial
    epoch, and the influence of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic on
    climate, are next considered. In <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVI">Chapter XXVI.</a> I have given the reasons
    which induce me to believe that coal is an inter-glacial formation.</p>

  <p>The next two chapters—the one on the path of the ice in north-western
    Europe, the other on the north of England ice-sheet—are reprints of
    papers which appeared a few years ago in the <cite>Geological Magazine</cite>.
    Recent observations have confirmed the truth of the views advanced
    in these two chapters, and they are rapidly gaining acceptance among
    geologists.</p>

  <p>I have given, at the conclusion, a statement of the molecular theory of
    glacier motion—a theory which I have been led to modify considerably on
    one particular point.</p>

  <p>There is one point to which I wish particularly to direct
    attention—viz., that I have studiously avoided introducing into the
    theories propounded anything of a hypothetical nature. There is not,
    so far as I am aware, from beginning to end of this volume, a single
    hypothetical element: nowhere have I attempted to give a hypothetical
    explanation. The conclusions are in every case derived either from
    facts or from what I believe to be admitted principles. In short, I
    have aimed to prove that the theory of secular changes of climate
    follows, as a necessary consequence, from the admitted principles of
    physical science.</p>

  <p><em>The absolute Heating-power of Ocean-currents.</em>—There is perhaps no
    physical agent concerned in the distribution of heat over the surface
    of the globe the influence of which has been so much underrated as that
    of ocean-currents. This is, no doubt, owing to the fact that although
    their surface-temperature, direction, and general influence have
    obtained considerable attention, yet little or nothing has been done
    towards determining the absolute amount of heat or of cold conveyed by
    them or the resulting absolute increase or decrease of temperature.</p>

  <p>The modern method of determining the amount of heat-effects in absolute
    measure is, doubtless, destined to cast new light on all questions
    connected with climate, as it has done, and is still doing, in every
    department of physics where energy, under the form of heat, is being
    studied. But this method has hardly as yet been attempted in questions
    of meteorology; and owing to the complicated nature of the phenomena
    with which the meteorologist has generally to deal, its application
    will very often prove practically impossible. Nevertheless, it is
    particularly suitable to all questions relating to the direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> thermal
    effects of currents, whatever the nature of these currents may happen
    to be.</p>

  <p>In the application of the method to an ocean-current, the two most
    important elements required as data are the volume of the stream and
    its mean temperature. But although we know something of the temperature
    of most of the great ocean-currents, yet, with the exception of the
    Gulf-stream, little has been ascertained regarding their volume.</p>

  <p>The breadth, depth, and temperature of the Gulf-stream have formed the
    subject of extensive and accurate observations by the United States
    Coast Survey. In the memoirs and charts of that survey cross-sections
    of the stream at various places are given, showing its breadth and
    depth, and also the temperature of the water from the surface to the
    bottom. We are thus enabled to determine with some precision the
    mean temperature of the stream. And knowing its mean velocity at any
    given section, we have likewise a means of determining the number of
    cubic feet of water passing through that section in a given time. But
    although we can obtain with tolerable accuracy the mean temperature,
    yet observations regarding the velocity of the water at all depths have
    unfortunately not been made at any particular section. Consequently we
    have no means of estimating as accurately as we could wish the volume
    of the current. Nevertheless, since we know the surface-velocity of the
    water at places where some of the sections were taken, we are enabled
    to make at least a rough estimate of the volume.</p>

  <p>From an examination of the published sections, I came to the conclusion
    some years ago<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that the total quantity of water conveyed by the
    stream is probably equal to that of a stream fifty miles broad and
    1,000 feet deep,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> flowing at the rate of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>four miles an hour,
    and that the mean temperature of the entire mass of moving water is
    not under 65° at the moment of leaving the Gulf. But to prevent the
    possibility of any objections being raised on the grounds that I may
    have over-estimated the volume of the stream, I shall take the velocity
    to be <em>two</em> miles instead of four miles an hour. We are warranted,
    I think, in concluding that the stream before it returns from its
    northern journey is on an average cooled down to at least 40°,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
    consequently it loses 25° of heat. Each cubic foot of water, therefore,
    in this case carries from the tropics for distribution upwards of
    1,158,000 foot-pounds of heat. According to the above estimate of the
    size and velocity of the stream, which in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI.</a> will be shown
    to be an under-estimate, 2,787,840,000,000 cubic feet of water are
    conveyed from the Gulf per hour, or 66,908,160,000,000 cubic feet
    daily. Consequently the total quantity of heat thus transferred per day
    amounts to 77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds.</p>

  <p>This estimate of the volume of the stream is considerably less by
    one-half than that given both by Captain Maury and by Sir John
    Herschel. Captain Maury considers the Gulf-stream equal to a stream
    thirty-two miles broad and 1,200 feet deep, flowing at the rate of five
    knots an hour.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This gives 6,165,700,000,000 cubic feet per hour
    as the quantity of water conveyed by this stream. Sir John Herschel’s
    estimate is still greater. He considers it equal to a stream thirty
    miles broad and 2,200 feet deep, flowing at the rate of four miles
    an hour.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This makes the quantity 7,359,900,000,000 cubic feet
    per hour. Dr. Colding, in his elaborate memoir on the Gulf-stream,
    estimates the volume at 5,760,000,000,000 cubic feet per hour, while
    Mr. Laughton’s estimate is nearly double that of mine.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

  <p>From observations made by Sir John Herschel and by M. Pouillet on the
    direct heat of the sun, it is found that, were no heat absorbed by the
    atmosphere, about eighty-three foot-pounds per second would fall upon
    a square foot of surface placed at right angles to the sun’s rays.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
    Mr. Meech estimates that the quantity of heat cut off by the atmosphere
    is equal to about twenty-two per cent. of the total amount received
    from the sun. M. Pouillet estimates the loss at twenty-four per cent.
    Taking the former estimate, 64·74 foot-pounds per second will therefore
    be the quantity of heat falling on a square foot of the earth’s surface
    when the sun is in the zenith. And were the sun to remain stationary in
    the zenith for twelve hours, 2,796,768 foot-pounds would fall upon the
    surface.</p>

  <p>It can be shown that the total amount of heat received upon a unit
    surface on the equator, during the twelve hours from sunrise till
    sunset at the time of the equinoxes, is to the total amount which
    would be received upon that surface, were the sun to remain in the
    zenith during those twelve hours, as the diameter of a circle to half
    its circumference, or as 1 to 1·5708. It follows, therefore, that
    a square foot of surface on the equator receives from the sun at
    the time of the equinoxes 1,780,474 foot-pounds daily, and a square
    mile 49,636,750,000,000 foot-pounds daily. But this amounts to only
    1/1560935th part of the quantity of heat daily conveyed from the
    tropics by the Gulf-stream. In other words, the Gulf-stream conveys as
    much heat as is received from the sun by 1,560,935 square miles at the
    equator. The amount thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which falls
    upon the globe within thirty-two miles on each side of the equator.
    According to calculations made by Mr. Meech,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the annual quantity
    of heat received by a unit surface on the frigid zone, taking the
    mean of the whole zone, is 5·45/12th of that received at the equator;
    consequently the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream in one
    year is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
    equal to the heat which falls on an average on 3,436,900 square miles
    of the arctic regions. The frigid zone or arctic regions contain
    8,130,000 square miles. There is actually, therefore, nearly one-half
    as much heat transferred from tropical regions by the Gulf-stream as
    is received from the sun by the entire arctic regions, the quantity
    conveyed from the tropics by the stream to that received from the sun
    by the arctic regions being nearly as two to five.</p>

  <p>But we have been assuming in our calculations that the percentage of
    heat absorbed by the atmosphere is no greater in polar regions than
    it is at the equator, which is not the case. If we make due allowance
    for the extra amount absorbed in polar regions in consequence of the
    obliqueness of the sun’s rays, the total quantity of heat conveyed by
    the Gulf-stream will probably be nearly equal to one-half the amount
    received from the sun by the entire arctic regions.</p>

  <p>If we compare the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream with
    that conveyed by means of aërial currents, the result is equally
    startling. The density of air to that of water is as 1 to 770, and
    its specific heat to that of water is as 1 to 4·2; consequently the
    same amount of heat that would raise 1 cubic foot of water 1° would
    raise 770 cubic feet of air 4°·2, or 3,234 cubic feet 1°. The quantity
    of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream is therefore equal to that which
    would be conveyed by a current of air 3,234 times the volume of the
    Gulf-stream, at the same temperature and moving with the same velocity.
    Taking, as before, the width of the stream at fifty miles, and its
    depth at 1,000 feet, and its velocity at two miles an hour, it follows
    that, in order to convey an equal amount of heat from the tropics by
    means of an aërial current, it would be necessary to have a current
    about 1¼ mile deep, and at the temperature of 65°, blowing at the
    rate of two miles an hour from every part of the equator over the
    northern hemisphere towards the pole. If its velocity were equal to
    that of a good sailing-breeze, which Sir John Herschel states to be
    about twenty-one miles an hour, the current would require to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> above
    600 feet deep. A greater quantity of heat is probably conveyed by the
    Gulf-stream alone from the tropical to the temperate and arctic regions
    than by all the aërial currents which flow from the equator.</p>

  <p>We are apt, on the other hand, to over-estimate the amount of the heat
    conveyed from tropical regions to us by means of aërial currents. The
    only currents which flow from the equatorial regions are the upper
    currents, or anti-trades as they are called. But it is not possible
    that much heat can be conveyed directly by them. The upper currents of
    the trade-winds, even at the equator, are nowhere below the snow-line;
    they must therefore lie in a region of which the temperature is
    actually below the freezing-point. In fact, if those currents were
    warm, they would elevate the snow-line above themselves. The heated air
    rising off the hot burning ground at the equator, after ascending a
    few miles, becomes exposed to the intense cold of the upper regions of
    the atmosphere; it then very soon loses all its heat, and returns from
    the equator much colder than it went thither. It is impossible that
    we can receive any heat directly from the equatorial regions by means
    of aërial currents. It is perfectly true that the south-west wind, to
    which we owe so much of our warmth in this country, is a continuation
    of the anti-trade; but the heat which this wind brings to us is not
    derived from the equatorial regions. This will appear evident, if we
    but reflect that, before the upper current descends to the snow-line
    after leaving the equator, it must traverse a space of at least 2,000
    miles; and to perform this long journey several days will be required.
    During all this time the air is in a region below the freezing-point;
    and it is perfectly obvious that by the time it begins to descend it
    must have acquired the temperature of the region in which it has been
    travelling.</p>

  <p>If such be the case, it is evident that a wind whose temperature
    is below 32° could never warm a country such as ours, where the
    temperature does not fall below 38° or 39°. The heat of our south-west
    winds is derived, not directly from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> equator, but from the warm
    water of the Atlantic—in fact, from the Gulf-stream. The upper current
    acquires its heat after it descends to the earth. There is one way,
    however, whereby heat is indirectly conveyed from the equator by the
    anti-trades; that is, in the form of aqueous vapour. In the formation
    of one pound of water from aqueous vapour, as Professor Tyndall
    strikingly remarks, a quantity of heat is given out sufficient to melt
    five pounds of cast iron.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It must, however, be borne in mind that
    the greater part of the moisture of the south-west and west winds is
    derived from the ocean in temperate regions. The upper current receives
    the greater part of its moisture after it descends to the earth, whilst
    the moisture received at the equator is in great part condensed, and
    falls as rain in those regions.</p>

  <p>This latter assertion has been so frequently called in question
    that I shall give my reasons for making it. According to Dr. Keith
    Johnston (“Physical Atlas”) the mean rainfall of the torrid regions
    is ninety-six inches per annum, while that of the temperate regions
    amounts to only thirty-seven inches. If the greater part of the
    moisture of the torrid regions does not fall as rain in those regions,
    it must fall as such beyond them. Now the area of the torrid to that
    of the two temperate regions is about as 39·3 to 51. Consequently
    ninety-six inches of rain spread over the temperate regions would give
    seventy-four inches; but this is double the actual rainfall of the
    temperate regions. If, again, it were spread over both temperate and
    polar regions this would yield sixty-four inches, which, however, is
    nearly double the mean rainfall of the temperate and polar regions. If
    we add to this the amount of moisture derived from the ocean within
    temperate and polar regions, we should have a far greater rainfall for
    these latitudes than for the torrid region, and we know, of course,
    that it is actually far less. This proves the truth of the assertion
    that by far the greater part of the moisture of the torrid regions
    falls in those regions as rain. It will hardly do to object that the
    above may <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>probably be an over-estimate of the amount of rainfall in
    the torrid zone, for it is not at all likely that any error will ever
    be found which will affect the general conclusion at which we have
    arrived.</p>

  <p>Dr. Carpenter, in proof of the small rainfall of the torrid zone,
    adduces the case of the Red Sea, where, although evaporation is
    excessive, almost no rain falls. But the reason why the vapour raised
    from the Red Sea does not fall in that region as rain, is no doubt
    owing to the fact that this sea is only a narrow strip of water in a
    dry and parched land, the air above which is too greedy of moisture
    to admit of the vapour being deposited as rain. Over a wide expanse
    of ocean, however, where the air above is kept to a great extent in a
    constant state of saturation, the case is totally different.</p>

  <p><em>Land at the Equator tends to Lower the Temperature of the Globe.</em>—The
    foregoing considerations, as well as many others which might be stated,
    lead to the conclusion that, in order to raise the mean temperature of
    the whole earth, <em>water</em> should be placed along the equator, and not
    <em>land</em>, as is supposed by Sir Charles Lyell and others. For if land is
    placed at the equator, the possibility of conveying the sun’s heat from
    the equatorial regions by means of ocean-currents is prevented. The
    transference of heat could then be effected only by means of the upper
    currents of the trades; for the heat conveyed by <em>conduction</em> along the
    solid crust, if any, can have no sensible effect on climate. But these
    currents, as we have just seen, are ill-adapted for conveying heat.</p>

  <p>The surface of the ground at the equator becomes intensely heated by
    the sun’s rays. This causes it to radiate its heat more rapidly into
    space than a surface of water heated under the same conditions. Again,
    the air in contact with the hot ground becomes also more rapidly
    heated than in contact with water, and consequently the ascending
    current of air carries off a greater amount of heat. But were the
    heat thus carried away transferred by means of the upper currents to
    high latitudes and there employed to warm the earth, then it might to
    a considerable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>extent compensate for the absence of ocean-currents,
    and in this case land at the equator might be nearly as well adapted
    as water for raising the temperature of the whole earth. But such is
    not the case; for the heat carried up by the ascending current at the
    equator is not employed in warming the earth, but is thrown off into
    the cold stellar space above. This ascending current, instead of being
    employed in warming the globe, is in reality one of the most effectual
    means that the earth has of getting quit of the heat received from the
    sun, and of thus maintaining a much lower temperature than it would
    otherwise possess. It is in the equatorial regions that the earth loses
    as well as gains the greater part of its heat; so that, of all places,
    here ought to be placed the substance best adapted for preventing the
    dissipation of the earth’s heat into space, in order to raise the
    general temperature of the earth. Water, of all substances in nature,
    seems to possess this quality to the greatest extent; and, besides, it
    is a fluid, and therefore adapted by means of currents to carry the
    heat which it receives from the sun to every region of the globe.</p>

  <p>These results show (although they have reference to only one stream)
    that the general influence of ocean-currents on the distribution of
    heat over the surface of the globe must be very great. If the quantity
    of heat transferred from equatorial regions by the Gulf-stream
    alone is nearly equal to all the heat received from the sun by the
    arctic regions, then how enormous must be the quantity conveyed from
    equatorial regions by all the ocean-currents together!</p>

  <p><em>Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of Europe.</em>—In a paper
    read before the British Association at Exeter, Mr. A. G. Findlay
    objects to the conclusions at which I have arrived in former papers
    on the subject, that I have not taken into account the great length
    of time that the water requires in order to circulate, and the
    interference it has to encounter in its passage.</p>

  <p>The objection is, that a stream so comparatively small as the
    Gulf-stream, after spreading out over such a large area of the
    Atlantic, and moving so slowly across to the shores of Europe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> losing
    heat all the way, would not be able to produce any very sensible
    influence on the climate of Europe.</p>

  <p>I am unable to perceive the force of this objection. Why, the very
    efficiency of the stream as a heating agent necessarily depends upon
    the slowness of its motion. Did the Gulf-stream move as rapidly along
    its whole course as it does in the Straits of Florida, it could produce
    no sensible effect on the climate of Europe. It does not require much
    consideration to perceive this. (1) If the stream during its course
    continued narrow, deep, and rapid, it would have little opportunity of
    losing its heat, and the water would carry back to the tropics the heat
    which it ought to have given off in the temperate and polar regions.
    (2) The Gulf-stream does not heat the shores of Europe by direct
    radiation. Our island, for example, is not heated by radiation from a
    stream of warm water flowing along its shores. The Gulf-stream heats
    our island <em>indirectly</em> by heating the winds which blow over it to our
    shores.</p>

  <p>The anti-trades, or upper return-currents, as we have seen, bring no
    heat from the tropical regions. After traversing some 2,000 miles
    in a region of extreme cold they descend on the Atlantic as a cold
    current, and there absorb the heat and moisture which they carry to
    north-eastern Europe. Those aërial currents derive their heat from the
    Gulf-stream, or if it is preferred, from the warm water poured into the
    Atlantic by the Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>How, then, are these winds heated by the warm water? The air is heated
    in two ways, viz., by direct <em>radiation</em> from the water, and by
    <em>contact</em> with the water. Now, if the Gulf-stream continued a narrow
    and deep current during its entire course similar to what it is at
    the Straits of Florida, it could have little or no opportunity of
    communicating its heat to the air either by radiation or by contact. If
    the stream were only about forty or fifty miles in breadth, the aërial
    particles in their passage across it would not be in contact with the
    warm water more than an hour or two. Moreover, the number of particles
    in contact with the water, owing to the narrowness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> stream,
    would be small, and there would therefore be little opportunity for
    the air becoming heated by contact. The same also holds true in regard
    to radiation. The more we widen the stream and increase its area, the
    more we increase its radiating surface; and the greater the radiating
    surface, the greater is the quantity of heat thrown off. But this is
    not all; the number of aërial particles heated by radiation increases
    in proportion to the area of the radiating surface; consequently, the
    wider the area over which the waters of the Gulf-stream are spread,
    the more effectual will the stream be as a heating agent. And, again,
    in order that a very wide area of the Atlantic may be covered with the
    warm waters of the stream, slowness of motion is essential.</p>

  <p>Mr. Findlay supposes that fully one-half of the Gulf-stream passes into
    the south-eastern branch, and that it is only the north-eastern branch
    of the current that can be effectual in raising the temperature of
    Europe. But it appears to me that it is to this south-eastern portion
    of the current, and not to the north-eastern, that we, in this country,
    are chiefly indebted for our heat. The south-west winds, to which we
    owe our heat, derive their temperature from this south-eastern portion
    which flows away in the direction of the Azores. The south-west winds
    which blow over the northern portion of the current which flows past
    our island up into the arctic seas cannot possibly cross this country,
    but will go to heat Norway and northern Europe. The north-eastern
    portion of the stream, no doubt, protects us from the ice of Greenland
    by warming the north-west winds which come to us from that cold region.</p>

  <p>Mr. Buchan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society, has
    shown<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that in a large tract of the Atlantic between latitudes 20°
    and 40° N., the mean pressure of the atmosphere is greater than in any
    other place on the globe. To the west of Madeira, between longitude
    10° and 40° W., the mean annual pressure amounts to 30·2 inches, while
    between Iceland and Spitzbergen it is only 29·6, a lower mean pressure
    than is found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>in any other place on the northern hemisphere. There
    must consequently, he concludes, be a general tendency in the air to
    flow from the former to the latter place along the earth’s surface.
    Now, the air in moving from the lower to the higher latitudes tends
    to take a north-easterly direction, and in this case will pass over
    our island in its course. This region of high pressure, however,
    is situated in the very path of the south-eastern branch of the
    Gulf-stream, and consequently the winds blowing therefrom will carry
    directly to Britain the heat of the Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>As we shall presently see, it is as essential to the heating of our
    island as to that of the southern portion of Europe, that a very large
    proportion of the waters of the Gulf-stream should spread over the
    surface of the Atlantic and never pass up into the arctic regions.</p>

  <p>Even according to Mr. Findlay’s own theory, it is to the south-west
    wind, heated by the warm waters of the Atlantic, that we are indebted
    for the high temperature of our climate. But he seems to be under the
    impression that the Atlantic would be able to supply the necessary
    heat independently of the Gulf-stream. This, it seems to me, is the
    fundamental error of all those who doubt the efficiency of the stream.
    It is a mistake, however, into which one is very apt to fall who does
    not adopt the more rigid method of determining heat-results in absolute
    measure. When we apply this method, we find that the Atlantic, without
    the aid of such a current as the Gulf-stream, would be wholly unable to
    supply the necessary amount of heat to the south-west winds.</p>

  <p>The quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream, as we have seen,
    is equal to all the heat received from the sun by 1,560,935 square
    miles at the equator. The mean annual quantity of heat received from
    the sun by the temperate regions per unit surface is to that received
    by the equator as 9·08 to 12.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Consequently, the quantity of heat
    conveyed by the stream is equal to all the heat received from the sun
    by 2,062,960 square <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>miles of the temperate regions. The total area of
    the Atlantic from the latitude of the Straits of Florida, 200 miles
    north of the tropic of Cancer, up to the Arctic Circle, including also
    the German Ocean, is about 8,500,000 square miles. In this case the
    quantity of heat carried by the Gulf-stream into the Atlantic through
    the Straits of Florida, is to that received by this entire area from
    the sun as 1 to 4·12, or in round numbers as 1 to 4. It therefore
    follows that one-fifth of all the heat possessed by the waters of the
    Atlantic over that area, even supposing that they absorb every ray that
    falls upon them, is derived from the Gulf-stream. Would those who call
    in question the efficiency of the Gulf-stream be willing to admit that
    a decrease of one-fourth in the total amount of heat received from the
    sun, over the entire area of the Atlantic from within 200 miles of
    the tropical zone up to the arctic regions, would not sensibly affect
    the climate of northern Europe? If they would not willingly admit
    this, why, then, contend that the Gulf-stream does not affect climate?
    for the stoppage of the Gulf-stream would deprive the Atlantic of
    77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds of energy in the form of heat
    per day, a quantity equal to one-fourth of all the heat received from
    the sun by that area.</p>

  <p>How much, then, of the temperature of the south-west winds derived from
    the water of the Atlantic is due to the Gulf-stream?</p>

  <p>Were the sun extinguished, the temperature over the whole earth
    would sink to <em>nearly</em> that of stellar space, which, according to
    the investigations of Sir John Herschel<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and of M. Pouillet,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
    is not above −239° F. Were the earth possessed of no atmosphere, the
    temperature of its surface would sink to exactly that of space, or to
    that indicated by a thermometer exposed to no other heat-influence than
    that of radiation from the stars. But the presence of the atmospheric
    envelope would slightly modify <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>the conditions of things; for the
    heat from the stars (which of course constitutes what is called the
    temperature of space) would, like the sun’s heat, pass more freely
    through the atmosphere than the heat radiated back from the earth, and
    there would in consequence of this be an accumulation of heat on the
    earth’s surface. The temperature would therefore stand a little higher
    than that of space; or, in other words, it would stand a little higher
    than it would otherwise do were the earth exposed in space to the
    direct radiation of the stars without the atmospheric envelope. But,
    for reasons which will presently be stated, we may in the meantime,
    till further light is cast upon this matter, take −239° F. as probably
    not far from what would be the temperature of the earth’s surface were
    the sun extinguished.</p>

  <p>Suppose now that we take the mean annual temperature of the Atlantic
    at, say, 56°.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Then 239° + 56° = 295° represents the number of
    degrees of rise due to the heat which it receives. In other words,
    it takes all the heat that the Atlantic receives to maintain its
    temperature 295° above the temperature of space. Stop the Gulf-stream,
    and the Atlantic would be deprived of one-fifth of the heat which
    it possesses. Then, if it takes five parts of heat to maintain a
    temperature of 295° above that of space, the four parts which would
    remain after the stream was stopped would only be able to maintain a
    temperature of four-fifths of 295°, or 236° above that of space: the
    stoppage of the Gulf-stream would therefore deprive the Atlantic of an
    amount of heat which would be sufficient to maintain its temperature
    59° above what it would otherwise be, did it depend alone upon the heat
    received directly from the sun. It does not, of course, follow that
    the Gulf-stream actually maintains the temperature 59° above what it
    would otherwise be were there no ocean-currents, because the actual
    heating-effect of the stream is neutralized to a very considerable
    extent by cold currents from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>the arctic regions. But 59° of rise
    represents its actual power; consequently 59°, minus the lowering
    effect of the cold currents, represents the actual rise. What the rise
    may amount to at any particular place must be determined by other means.</p>

  <p>This method of calculating how much the temperature of the earth’s
    surface would rise or fall from an increase or a decrease in the
    absolute amount of heat received is that adopted by Sir John Herschel
    in his “Outlines of Astronomy,” § 369<sup>a</sup>.</p>

  <p>About three years ago, in an article in the <cite>Reader</cite>, I endeavoured
    to show that this method is not rigidly correct. It has been shown
    from the experiments of Dulong and Petit, Dr. Balfour Stewart,
    Professor Draper, and others, that the rate at which a body radiates
    its heat off into space is not directly proportionate to its absolute
    temperature. The rate at which a body loses its heat as its temperature
    rises increases more rapidly than the temperature. As a body rises
    in temperature the rate at which it radiates off its heat increases;
    the <em>rate</em> of this increase, however, is not uniform, but increases
    with the temperature. Consequently the temperature is not lowered in
    proportion to the decrease of the sun’s heat. But at the comparatively
    low temperature with which we have at present to deal, the error
    resulting from assuming the decrease of temperature to be proportionate
    to the decrease of heat would not be great.</p>

  <p>It may be remarked, however, that the experiments referred to were
    made on solids; but, from certain results arrived at by Dr. Balfour
    Stewart, it would seem that the radiation of a material particle may
    be proportionate to its absolute temperature.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This physicist found
    that the radiation of a thick plate of glass increases more rapidly
    than that of a thin plate as the temperature rises, and that, if we go
    on continually diminishing the thickness of the plate whose radiation
    at different temperatures we are ascertaining, we find that as it grows
    thinner and thinner the rate at which it radiates off its heat as its
    temperature rises becomes less and less. In other words, as the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>plate
    grows thinner and thinner its rate of radiation becomes more and more
    proportionate to its absolute temperature. And we can hardly resist the
    conviction that if we could possibly go on diminishing the thickness
    of the plate till we reached a film so thin as to embrace but only one
    particle in its thickness, its rate of radiation would be proportionate
    to its temperature. Dr. Balfour Stewart has very ingeniously suggested
    the probable reason why the rate of radiation of thick plates increases
    with rise of temperature more rapidly than that of thin. It is this:
    all substances are more diathermanous for heat of high temperatures
    than for heat of low temperatures. When a body is at a low temperature,
    we may suppose that only the exterior rows of particles supply the
    radiation, the heat from the interior particles being all stopped by
    the exterior ones, the substance being very opaque for heat of low
    temperature; while at a high temperature we may imagine that part
    of the heat from the interior particles is allowed to pass, thereby
    swelling the total radiation. But as the plate becomes thinner and
    thinner, the obstructions to interior radiation become less and less,
    and as these obstructions are greater for radiation at low temperatures
    than for radiation at high temperatures, it necessarily follows that,
    by reducing the thickness of the plate, we assist radiation at low
    temperatures more than we do at high.</p>

  <p>In a gas, where each particle may be assumed to radiate by itself, and
    where the particles stand at a considerable distance from one another,
    the obstruction to interior radiation must be far less than in a
    solid. In this case the rate at which a gas radiates off its heat as
    its temperature rises must increase more slowly than that of a solid
    substance. In other words, its rate of radiation must correspond more
    nearly to its absolute temperature than that of a solid. If this be the
    case, a reduction in the amount of heat received from the sun, owing to
    an increase of his distance, should tend to produce a greater lowering
    effect on the temperature of the air than it does on the temperature of
    the solid ground. But as the temperature of our climate is determined
    by the temperature of the air, it must follow that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> the error of
    assuming that the decrease of temperature would be proportionate to the
    decrease in the intensity of the sun’s heat may not be great.</p>

  <p>It may be observed here, although it does not bear directly on this
    point, that although the air in a room, for example, or at the earth’s
    surface is principally cooled by convection rather than by radiation,
    yet it is by radiation alone that the earth’s atmosphere parts with its
    heat to stellar space; and this is the chief matter with which we are
    at present concerned. Air, like all other gases, is a bad radiator;
    and this tends to protect it from being cooled to such an extent as it
    would otherwise be, were it a good radiator like solids. True, it is
    also a bad absorber; but as it is cooled by radiation into space, and
    heated, not altogether by absorption, but to a very large extent by
    convection, it on the whole gains its heat more easily than it loses
    it, and consequently must stand at a higher temperature than it would
    do were it heated by absorption alone.</p>

  <p>But, to return; the error of regarding the decrease of temperature
    as proportionate to the decrease in the amount of heat received, is
    probably neutralized by one of an opposite nature, viz., that of taking
    space at too high a temperature; for by so doing we make the result too
    small.</p>

  <p>We know that absolute zero is at least 493° below the melting-point
    of ice. This is 222° below that of space. Consequently, if the heat
    derived from the stars is able to maintain a temperature of −239°,
    or 222° of absolute temperature, then nearly as much heat is derived
    from the stars as from the sun. But if so, why do the stars give so
    much heat and so very little light? If the radiation from the stars
    could maintain a thermometer 222° above absolute zero, then space must
    be far more transparent to heat-rays than to light-rays, or else the
    stars give out a great amount of heat, but very little light, neither
    of which suppositions is probably true. The probability is, I venture
    to presume, that the temperature of space is not very much above
    absolute zero. At the time when these investigations into the probable
    temperature of space were made, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> least as regards the labours of
    Pouillet, the modern science of heat had no existence, and little or
    nothing was then known with certainty regarding absolute zero. In this
    case the whole matter would require to be reconsidered. The result of
    such an investigation in all probability would be to assign a lower
    temperature to stellar space than −239°.</p>

  <p>Taking all these various considerations into account, it is probable
    that if we adopt −239° as the temperature of space, we shall not be far
    from the truth in assuming that the absolute temperature of a place
    above that of space is proportionate to the amount of heat received
    from the sun.</p>

  <p>We may, therefore, in this case conclude that 59° of rise is probably
    not very far from the truth, as representing the influence of the
    Gulf-stream. The Gulf-stream, instead of producing little or no effect,
    produces an effect far greater than is generally supposed.</p>

  <p>Our island has a mean annual temperature of about 12° above the normal
    due to its latitude. This excess of temperature has been justly
    attributed to the influence of the Gulf-stream. But it is singular
    how this excess should have been taken as the measure of the <em>rise
    resulting from the influence of the stream</em>. These figures only
    represent the number of degrees that the mean normal temperature of
    our island stands above what is called the normal temperature of the
    latitude.</p>

  <p>The mode in which Professor Dove constructed his Tables of normal
    temperature was as follows:—He took the temperature of thirty-six
    equidistant points on every ten degrees of latitude. The mean
    temperature of these thirty-six points he calls in each case the
    <em>normal</em> temperature of the parallel. The excess above the normal
    merely represents how much the stream raises our temperature above
    the mean of all places on the same latitude, but it affords us no
    information regarding the absolute rise produced. In the Pacific, as
    well as in the Atlantic, there are immense masses of water flowing
    from the tropical to the temperate regions. Now, unless we know how
    much of the normal temperature of a latitude is due to ocean-currents,
    and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> much to the direct heat of the sun, we could not possibly,
    from Professor Dove’s Tables, form the most distant conjecture as
    to how much of our temperature is derived from the Gulf-stream. The
    overlooking of this fact has led to a general misconception regarding
    the positive influence of the Gulf-stream on temperature. The 12°
    marked in Tables of normal temperature do not represent the absolute
    effect of the stream, but merely show how much the stream raises the
    temperature of our country above the mean of all places on the same
    latitude. Other places have their temperature raised by ocean-currents
    as well as this country; only the Gulf-stream produces a rise of
    several degrees over and above that produced by other streams in the
    same latitude.</p>

  <p>At present there is a difference merely of 80° between the mean
    temperature of the equator and the poles;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but were each part of the
    globe’s surface to depend only upon the direct heat which it receives
    from the sun, there ought, according to theory, to be a difference of
    more than 200°. The annual quantity of heat received at the equator is
    to that received at the poles (supposing the proportionate quantity
    absorbed by the atmosphere to be the same in both cases) as 12 to 4·98,
    or, say, as 12 to 5. Consequently, if the temperatures of the equator
    and the poles be taken as proportionate to the absolute amount of heat
    received from the sun, then the temperature of the equator above that
    of space must be to that of the poles above that of space as 12 to 5.
    What ought, therefore, to be the temperatures of the equator and the
    poles, did each place depend solely upon the heat which it receives
    directly from the sun? Were all ocean and aërial currents stopped,
    so that there could be no transference of heat from one part of the
    earth’s surface to another, what ought to be the temperatures of the
    equator and the poles? We can at least arrive at a rough estimate
    on this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>point. If we diminish the quantity of warm water conveyed
    from the equatorial regions to the temperate and arctic regions, the
    temperature of the equator will begin to rise, and that of the poles
    to sink. It is probable, however, that this process would affect the
    temperature of the poles more than it would that of the equator; for as
    the warm water flows from the equator to the poles, the area over which
    it is spread becomes less and less. But as the water from the tropics
    has to raise the temperature of the temperate regions as well as the
    polar, the difference of effect at the equator and poles might not, on
    that account, be so very great. Let us take a rough estimate. Say that,
    as the temperature of the equator rises one degree, the temperature of
    the poles sinks one degree and a half. The mean annual temperature of
    the globe is about 58°. The mean temperature of the equator is 80°, and
    that of the poles 0°. Let ocean and aërial currents now begin to cease,
    the temperature of the equator commences to rise and the temperature
    of the poles to sink. For every degree that the temperature of the
    equator rises, that of the poles sinks 1½°; and when the currents are
    all stopped and each place becomes dependent solely upon the direct
    rays of the sun, the mean annual temperature of the equator above that
    of space will be to that of the poles, above that of space, as 12 to
    5. When this proportion is reached, the equator will be 374° above
    that of space, and the poles 156°; for 374 is to 156 as 12 is to 5.
    The temperature of space we have seen to be −239°, consequently the
    temperature of the equator will in this case be 135°, reckoned from the
    zero of the Fahrenheit thermometer, and the poles 83° below zero. The
    equator would therefore be 55° warmer than at present, and the poles
    83° colder. The difference between the temperature of the equator and
    the poles will in this case amount to 218°.</p>

  <p>Now, if we take into account the quantity of positive energy in the
    form of heat carried by warm currents from the equator to the temperate
    and polar regions, and also the quantity of negative energy (cold)
    carried by cold currents from the polar regions to the equator, we
    shall find that they are sufficient to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> reduce the difference of
    temperature between the poles and the equator from 218° to 80°.</p>

  <p>The quantity of heat received in the latitude of London, for example,
    is to that received at the equator nearly as 12 to 8. This, according
    to theory, should produce a difference of about 125°. The temperature
    of the equator above that of space, as we have seen, would be 374°.
    Therefore 249° above that of space would represent the temperature
    of the latitude of London. This would give 10° as its temperature.
    The stoppage of all ocean and aërial currents would thus increase the
    difference between the equator and the latitude of London by about
    85°. The stoppage of ocean-currents would not be nearly so much felt,
    of course, in the latitude of London as at the equator and the poles,
    because, as has been already noticed, in all latitudes midway between
    the equator and the poles the two sets of currents to a considerable
    extent compensate each other—the warm currents from the equator
    raise the temperature, while the cold ones from the poles lower it;
    but as the warm currents chiefly keep on the surface and the cold
    return-currents are principally under-currents, the heating effect very
    greatly exceeds the cooling effect. Now, as we have seen, the stoppage
    of all currents would raise the temperature of the equator 55°; that
    is to say, the rise at the equator alone would increase the difference
    of temperature between the equator and that of London by 55°. But the
    actual difference, as we have seen, ought to be 85°; consequently the
    temperature of London would be lowered 30° by the stoppage of the
    currents. For if we raise the temperature of the equator 55° and lower
    the temperature of London 30°, we then increase the difference by
    85°. The normal temperature of the latitude of London being 40°, the
    stoppage of all ocean and aërial currents would thus reduce it to 10°.
    But the Gulf-stream raises the actual mean temperature of London 10°
    above the normal. Consequently 30° + 10° = 40° represents the actual
    rise at London due to the influence of the Gulf-stream over and above
    all the lowering effects resulting from arctic currents. On some parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
    of the American shores on the latitude of London, the temperature is
    10° below the normal. The stoppage of all ocean and aërial currents
    would therefore lower the temperature there only 20°.</p>

  <p>It is at the equator and the poles that the great system of ocean and
    aërial currents produces its maximum effects. The influence becomes
    less and less as we recede from those places, and between them there
    is a point where the influence of warm currents from the equator and
    of cold currents from the poles exactly neutralize each other. At
    this point the stoppage of ocean-currents would not sensibly affect
    temperature. This point, of course, is not situated on the same
    latitude in all meridians, but varies according to the position of the
    meridian in relation to land, and ocean-currents, whether cold or hot,
    and other circumstances. A line drawn round the globe through these
    various points would be very irregular. At one place, such as on the
    western side of the Atlantic, where the arctic current predominates,
    the neutral line would be deflected towards the equator, while on
    the eastern side, where warm currents predominate, the line would be
    deflected towards the north. It is a difficult problem to determine the
    mean position of this line; it probably lies somewhere not far north of
    the tropics.</p>

  <p><em>Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of the Arctic
    Regions.</em>—Does the Gulf-stream pass into the arctic regions? Are the
    seas around Spitzbergen and North Greenland heated by the warm water of
    the stream?</p>

  <p>Those who deny this nevertheless admit the existence of an arctic
    current. They admit that an immense mass of cold water is continually
    flowing south from the polar regions around Greenland into the
    Atlantic. If it be admitted, then, that a mass of water flows across
    the arctic circle from north to south, it must also be admitted that an
    equal mass flows across from south to north. It is also evident that
    the water crossing from south to north must be warmer than the water
    crossing from north to south; for the temperate regions are warmer than
    the arctic, and the ocean in temperate regions warmer than the ocean in
    the arctic; consequently the current which flows into the arctic seas,
    to compensate for the cold arctic current, must be a warmer current.</p>

  <p>Is the Gulf-stream this warm current? Does this compensating warm
    current proceed from the Atlantic or from the Pacific? If it proceeds
    from the Atlantic, it is simply the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> warm water of the Gulf-stream.
    We may call it the warm water of the Atlantic if we choose; but this
    cannot materially affect the question at issue, for the heat which
    the waters of the Atlantic possess is derived, as we have seen, to
    an enormous extent from the water brought from the tropics by the
    Gulf-stream. If we deny that the warm compensating current comes from
    the Atlantic, then we must assume that it comes from the Pacific. But
    if the cold current flows from the arctic regions into the Atlantic,
    and the warm compensating current from the Pacific into the arctic
    regions, the highest temperature should be found on the Pacific side of
    the arctic regions and not on the Atlantic side; the reverse, however,
    is the case. In the Atlantic, for example, the 41° isothermal line
    reaches to latitude 65°30′, while in the Pacific it nowhere goes beyond
    latitude 57°. The 27° isotherm reaches to latitude 75° in the Atlantic,
    but in the Pacific it does not pass beyond 64°. And the 14° isotherm
    reaches the north of Spitzbergen in latitude 80°, whereas on the
    Pacific side of the arctic regions it does not reach to latitude 72°.</p>

  <p>On no point of the earth’s surface does the mean annual temperature
    rise so high above the normal as in the northern Atlantic, just at
    the arctic circle, at a spot believed to be in the middle of the
    Gulf-stream. This place is no less than 22°·5 above the normal, while
    in the northern Pacific the temperature does not anywhere rise more
    than 9° above the normal. These facts prove that the warm current
    passes up the Atlantic into the arctic regions and not up the Pacific,
    or at least that the larger amount of warm water must pass into the
    arctic regions through the Atlantic. In other words, the Gulf-stream is
    the warm compensating current. Not only must there be a warm stream,
    but one of very considerable magnitude, in order to compensate for the
    great amount of cold water that is constantly flowing from the arctic
    regions, and also to maintain the temperature of those regions so much
    above the temperature of space as they actually are.</p>

  <p>No doubt, when the results of the late dredging expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> are
    published, they will cast much additional light on the direction and
    character of the currents forming the north-eastern branch of the
    Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>The average quantity of heat received by the arctic regions as a whole
    per unit surface to that received at the equator, as we have already
    seen, is as 5·45 to 12, assuming that the percentage of rays cut off by
    the atmosphere is the same at both places. In this case the mean annual
    temperature of the arctic regions, taken as a whole, would be about
    −69°, did those regions depend entirely for their temperature upon the
    heat received directly from the sun. But the temperature would not even
    reach to this; for the percentage of rays cut off by the atmosphere in
    arctic regions is generally believed to be greater than at the equator,
    and consequently the actual mean quantity of heat received by the
    arctic regions will be less than 5·45−12ths of what is received at the
    equator.</p>

  <p>In the article on Climate in the “Encyclopædia Britannica” there is
    a Table calculated upon the principle that the quantity of heat cut
    off is proportionate to the number of aërial particles which the rays
    have to encounter before reaching the surface of the earth—that, as
    a general rule, if the tracts of the rays follow an arithmetical
    progression, the diminished force with which the rays reach the ground
    will form a decreasing geometrical progression. According to this Table
    about 75 per cent. of the sun’s rays are cut off by the atmosphere
    in arctic regions. If 75 per cent. of the rays were cut off by the
    atmosphere in arctic regions, then the direct rays of the sun could
    not maintain a mean temperature 100° above that of space. But this is
    no doubt much too high a percentage for the quantity of heat cut off;
    for recent discoveries in regard to the absorption of radiant heat by
    gases and vapours prove that Tables computed on this principle must be
    incorrect. The researches of Tyndall and Melloni show that when rays
    pass through any substance, the absorption is rapid at first: but the
    rays are soon “sifted,” as it is called, and they then pass onwards
    with but little further obstruction. Still, however, owing to the dense
    fogs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> which prevail in arctic regions, the quantity of heat cut off
    must be considerable. If as much as 50 per cent. of the sun’s rays
    are cut off by the atmosphere in arctic regions, the amount of heat
    received directly from the sun would not be sufficient to maintain a
    mean annual temperature of −100°. Consequently the arctic regions must
    depend to an enormous extent upon ocean-currents for their temperature.</p>

  <p><em>Influence of Ocean-currents shown by another Method.</em>—That the
    temperature of the arctic regions would sink enormously, and the
    temperature of the equator rise enormously, were all ocean-currents
    stopped, can be shown by another method—viz., by taking the mean annual
    temperature from the equator to the pole along a meridian passing
    through the ocean, say, the Atlantic, and comparing it with the mean
    annual temperature taken along a meridian passing through a great
    continent, say, the Asiatic.</p>

  <p>Professor J. D. Forbes, in an interesting memoir,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> has endeavoured
    by this method to determine what would be the temperature of the
    equator and the poles were the globe all water or all land. He has
    taken the temperature of the two meridians from the tables and charts
    of Professor Dove, and ascertained the exact proportion of land and
    water on every 10° of latitude from the equator to the poles, with the
    view of determining what proportion of the average temperature of the
    globe in each parallel is due to the land, and what to the water which
    respectively belongs to it. He next endeavours to obtain a formula for
    expressing the mean temperature of a given parallel, and thence arrives
    at “an approximate answer to the inquiry as to what would have been the
    equatorial or polar temperature of the globe, or that of any latitude,
    had its surface been entirely composed of land or of water.”</p>

  <p>The result at which he arrived is this: that, were the surface of
    the globe all water, 71°·7 would be the temperature of the equator,
    and 12°·5 the temperature of the poles; and were the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>surface all
    land, 109°·8 would be the temperature of the equator, and −25°·6 the
    temperature of the poles.</p>

  <p>But in Professor Forbes’s calculations no account whatever is taken
    of the influence of currents, whether of water or of air, and the
    difference of temperature is attributed wholly to difference of
    latitude and the physical properties of land and water in relation to
    their powers in absorbing and detaining the sun’s rays, and to the laws
    of conduction and of convection which regulate the internal motion of
    heat in the one and in the other. He considers that the effects of
    currents are all compensatory.</p>

  <p>“If a current of hot water,” he says, “moderates the cold of a Lapland
    winter, the counter-current, which brings the cold of Greenland to the
    shores of the United States, in a great measure restores the balance of
    temperature, so far as it is disturbed by this particular influence.
    The prevalent winds, in like manner, including the trade-winds, though
    they render some portions of continents, on the average, hotter or
    colder than others, produce just the contrary effect elsewhere. Each
    continent, if it has a cold eastern shore, has likewise a warm western
    one; and even local winds have for the most part established laws of
    compensation. In a given parallel of latitude all these secondary
    causes of local climate may be imagined to be mutually compensatory,
    and the outstanding gradation of mean or normal temperature will
    mainly depend, 1st, upon the effect of latitude simply; 2nd, on
    the distribution of land and water considered in their primary or
    <em>statical</em> effect.”</p>

  <p>It is singular that a physicist so acute as Professor Forbes should,
    in a question such as this, leave out of account the influence of
    currents, under the impression that their effects were compensatory.</p>

  <p>If there is a constant transference of hot water from the equatorial
    regions to the polar, and of cold water from the polar regions to the
    equatorial (a thing which Professor Forbes admitted), then there can
    only be one place between the equator and the pole where the two sets
    of currents compensate each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> other. At all places on the equatorial
    side of this point a cooling effect is the result. Starting from this
    neutral point, the preponderance of the cooling effect over the heating
    increases as we approach towards the equator, and the preponderance of
    the heating effect over the cooling increases as we recede from this
    point towards the pole—the cooling effect reaching a maximum at the
    equator, and the heating effect a maximum at the pole.</p>

  <p>Had Professor Forbes observed this important fact, he would have
    seen at once that the low temperature of the land in high latitudes,
    in comparison with that of the sea, was no index whatever as to
    how much the temperature of those regions would sink were the sea
    entirely removed and the surface to become land; for the present
    high temperature of the sea is not due wholly to the mere physical
    properties of water, but to a great extent is due to the heat brought
    by currents from the equator. Now, unless it is known how much of
    the absolute temperature of the ocean in those latitudes is due to
    currents, we cannot tell how much the removal of the sea would lower
    the absolute temperature of those places. Were the sea removed,
    the continents in high latitudes would not simply lose the heating
    advantages which they presently derive from the mere fact of their
    proximity to so much sea, but the removal would, in addition to this,
    deprive them of an enormous amount of heat which they at present
    receive from the tropics by means of ocean-currents. And, on the other
    hand, at the equator, were the sea removed, the continents there
    would not simply lose the cooling influences which result from their
    proximity to so much water, but, in addition to this, they would have
    to endure the scorching effects which would result from the heat which
    is at present carried away from the tropics by ocean-currents.</p>

  <p>We have already seen that Professor Forbes concluded that the
    removal of the sea would raise the mean temperature of the equator
    30°, and lower the temperature of the poles 28°; it is therefore
    perfectly certain that, had he added to his result the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> effect due to
    ocean-currents, and had he been aware that about one-fifth of all the
    heat possessed by the Atlantic is actually derived from the equator by
    means of the Gulf-stream, he would have assigned a temperature to the
    equator and the poles, of a globe all land, differing not very far from
    what I have concluded would be the temperature of those places were all
    ocean and aërial currents stopped, and each place to depend solely upon
    the heat which it received directly from the sun.</p>

  <p><em>Without Ocean-currents the Globe would not be habitable.</em>—All these
    foregoing considerations show to what an extent the climatic condition
    of our globe is due to the thermal influences of ocean-currents.</p>

  <p>As regards the northern hemisphere, we have two immense oceans, the
    Pacific and the Atlantic, extending from the equator to near the north
    pole, or perhaps to the pole altogether. Between these two oceans lie
    two great continents, the eastern and the western. Owing to the earth’s
    spherical form, far too much heat is received at the equator and far
    too little at high latitudes to make the earth a suitable habitation
    for sentient beings. The function of these two great oceans is to
    remove the heat from the equator and carry it to temperate and polar
    regions. Aërial currents could not do this. They might remove the heat
    from the equator, but they could not, as we have already seen, carry
    it to the temperate and polar regions; for the greater portion of the
    heat which aërial currents remove from the equator is dissipated into
    stellar space: the ocean alone can convey the heat to distant shores.
    But aërial currents have a most important function; for of what avail
    would it be, though ocean-currents should carry heat to high latitudes,
    if there were no means of distributing the heat thus conveyed over the
    land? The function of aërial currents is to do this. Upon this twofold
    arrangement depends the thermal condition of the globe. Exclude the
    waters of the Pacific and the Atlantic from temperate and polar regions
    and place them at the equator, and nothing now existing on the globe
    could live in high latitudes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

  <p>Were these two great oceans placed beside each other on one side of the
    globe, and the two great continents placed beside each other on the
    other side, the northern hemisphere would not then be suitable for the
    present order of things: the land on the central and on the eastern
    side of the united continent would be far too cold.</p>

  <p><em>The foregoing Conclusions not affected by the Imperfection of the
    Data.</em>—The general results at which we have arrived in reference to the
    influence of ocean-currents on the climatic condition of the globe are
    not affected by the imperfection of the data employed. It is perfectly
    true that considerable uncertainty prevails regarding some of the data;
    but, after making the fullest allowance for every possible error, the
    influence of currents is so enormous that the general conclusion cannot
    be materially affected. I can hardly imagine that any one familiar
    with the physics of the subject will be likely to think that, owing to
    possible errors in the data, the effects have probably been doubled.
    Even admitting, however, that this were proved to be the case, still
    that would not materially alter the general conclusion at which we
    have arrived. The influence of ocean-currents in the distribution of
    heat over the surface of the globe would still be admittedly enormous,
    whether we concluded that owing to them the present temperature of the
    equator is 55° or 27° colder than it would otherwise be, or the poles
    83° or 41° hotter than they would be did no currents exist.</p>

  <p>Nay, more, suppose we should again halve the result; even in that case
    we should have to admit that, owing to ocean-currents, the equator
    is about 14° colder and the poles about 21° hotter than they would
    otherwise be; in other words, we should have to admit that, were it not
    for ocean-currents, the mean temperature of the equator would be about
    100° and the mean temperature of the poles about −21°.</p>

  <p>If the influence of ocean-currents in reducing the difference between
    the temperature of the equator and poles amounted to only a few
    degrees, it would of course be needless to put much weight on any
    results arrived at by the method of calculation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> which I have adopted;
    but when it is a matter of two hundred degrees, it is not at all likely
    that the general results will be very much affected by any errors which
    may ever be found in the data.</p>

  <p>Objections of a palæontological nature have frequently been urged
    against the opinion that our island is much indebted for its mild
    climate to the influence of the Gulf-stream; but, from what has already
    been stated, it must be apparent that all objections of that nature
    are of little avail. The palæontologist may detect, from the character
    of the flora and fauna brought up from the sea-bottom by dredging and
    other means, the presence of a warm or of a cold current; but this can
    never enable him to prove that the temperate and polar regions are
    not affected to an enormous extent by warm water conveyed from the
    equatorial regions. For anything that palæontology can show to the
    contrary, were ocean-currents to cease, the mean annual temperature
    of our island might sink below the present midwinter temperature of
    Siberia. What would be the thermal condition of our globe were there no
    ocean-currents is a question for the physicist; not for the naturalist.</p>

  <p><em>Primary cause of Change of Eccentricity of the Earth’s Orbit.</em>—There
    are two causes affecting the position of the earth in relation to
    the sun, which must, to a very large extent, influence the earth’s
    climate; viz., the precession of the equinoxes and the change in the
    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. If we duly examine the combined
    influence of these two causes, we shall find that the northern and
    southern portions of the globe are subject to an excessively slow
    secular change of climate, consisting in a slow periodic change of
    alternate warmer and colder cycles.</p>

  <p>According to the calculations of Leverrier, the superior limit of the
    earth’s eccentricity is 0·07775.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The eccentricity is at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>present
    diminishing, and will continue to do so during 23,980 years, from the
    year 1800 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when its value will be then ·00314.</p>

  <p>The change in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit may affect
    the climate in two different ways; viz., by either increasing or
    diminishing the mean annual amount of heat received from the sun, or
    by increasing or diminishing the difference between summer and winter
    temperature.</p>

  <p>Let us consider the former case first. The total quantity of heat
    received from the sun during one revolution is inversely proportional
    to the minor axis.</p>

  <p>The difference of the minor axis of the orbit when at its maximum and
    its minimum state of eccentricity is as 997 to 1000. This small amount
    of difference cannot therefore sensibly affect the climate. Hence we
    must seek for our cause in the second case under consideration.</p>

  <p>There is of course as yet some little uncertainty in regard to the
    exact mean distance of the sun. I shall, however, in the present volume
    assume it to be 91,400,000 miles. When the eccentricity is at its
    superior limit, the distance of the sun from the earth, when the latter
    is in the aphelion of its orbit, is no less than 98,506,350 miles;
    and when in the perihelion it is only 84,293,650 miles. The earth is
    therefore 14,212,700 miles further from the sun in the former position
    than in the latter. The direct heat of the sun being inversely as the
    square of the distance, it follows that the amount of heat received
    by the earth when in these two positions will be as 19 to 26. Taking
    the present eccentricity to be ·0168, the earth’s distance during
    winter, when nearest to the sun, is 89,864,480 miles. Suppose now that,
    according to the precession of the equinoxes, winter in our northern
    hemisphere should happen when the earth is in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>the aphelion of its
    orbit, at the time when the orbit is at its greatest eccentricity; the
    earth would then be 8,641,870 miles further from the sun in winter than
    at present. The direct heat of the sun would therefore be one-fifth
    less during that season than at present; and in summer one-fifth
    greater. This enormous difference would affect the climate to a very
    great extent. But if winter under these circumstances should happen
    when the earth is in the perihelion of its orbit, the earth would then
    be 14,212,700 miles nearer the sun in winter than in summer. In this
    case the difference between winter and summer in the latitude of this
    country would be almost annihilated. But as the winter in the one
    hemisphere corresponds with the summer in the other, it follows that
    while the one hemisphere would be enduring the greatest extremes of
    summer heat and winter cold, the other would be enjoying a perpetual
    summer.</p>

  <p>It is quite true that whatever may be the eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit, the two hemispheres must receive equal quantities of heat per
    annum; for proximity to the sun is exactly compensated by the effect of
    swifter motion—the total amount of heat received from the sun between
    the two equinoxes is the same in both halves of the year, whatever the
    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit may be. For example, whatever extra
    heat the southern hemisphere may at present receive from the sun during
    its summer months owing to greater proximity to the sun, is exactly
    compensated by a corresponding loss arising from the shortness of the
    season; and, on the other hand, whatever deficiency of heat we in the
    northern hemisphere may at present have during our summer half year
    in consequence of the earth’s distance from the sun, is also exactly
    compensated by a corresponding length of season.</p>

  <p>It has been shown in the introductory chapter that a simple change in
    the sun’s distance would not alone produce a glacial epoch, and that
    those physicists who confined their attention to purely astronomical
    effects were perfectly correct in affirming that no increase of
    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit could account for that epoch. But
    the important fact was overlooked that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> although the glacial epoch
    could not result directly from an increase of eccentricity, it might
    nevertheless do so indirectly. The glacial epoch, as I hope to show,
    was not due directly to an increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit, but to a number of physical agents that were brought into
    operation as a result of an increase.</p>

  <p>I shall now proceed to give an outline of what these physical agents
    were, how they were brought into operation, and the way in which they
    led to the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>When the eccentricity is about its superior limit, the combined
    effect of all those causes to which I allude is to lower to a very
    great extent the temperature of the hemisphere whose winters occur in
    aphelion, and to raise to nearly as great an extent the temperature of
    the opposite hemisphere, where winter of course occurs in perihelion.</p>

  <p>With the eccentricity at its superior limit and the winter occurring
    in the aphelion, the earth would be 8,641,870 miles further from the
    sun during that season than at present. The reduction in the amount
    of heat received from the sun owing to this increased distance would,
    upon the principle we have stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>, lower the midwinter
    temperature to an enormous extent. In temperate regions the greater
    portion of the moisture of the air is at present precipitated in the
    form of rain, and the very small portion which falls as snow disappears
    in the course of a few weeks at most. But in the circumstances under
    consideration, the mean winter temperature would be lowered so much
    below the freezing-point that what now falls as rain during that season
    would then fall as snow. This is not all; the winters would then not
    only be colder than now, but they would also be much longer. At present
    the winters are nearly eight days shorter than the summers; but with
    the eccentricity at its superior limit and the winter solstice in
    aphelion, the length of the winters would exceed that of the summers by
    no fewer than thirty-six days. The lowering of the temperature and the
    lengthening of the winter would both tend to the same effect, viz., to
    increase the amount of snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> accumulated during the winter; for, other
    things being equal, the larger the snow-accumulating period the greater
    the accumulation. I may remark, however, that the absolute quantity
    of heat received during winter is not affected by the decrease in the
    sun’s heat,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for the additional length of the season compensates
    for this decrease. As regards the absolute amount of heat received,
    increase of the sun’s distance and lengthening of the winter are
    compensatory, but not so in regard to the amount of snow accumulated.</p>

  <p>The consequence of this state of things would be that, at the
    commencement of the short summer, the ground would be covered with the
    winter’s accumulation of snow.</p>

  <p>Again, the presence of so much snow would lower the summer temperature,
    and prevent to a great extent the melting of the snow.</p>

  <p>There are three separate ways whereby accumulated masses of snow and
    ice tend to lower the summer temperature, viz.:—</p>

  <p><em>First.</em> By means of direct radiation. No matter what the intensity of
    the sun’s rays may be, the temperature of snow and ice can never rise
    above 32°. Hence the presence of snow and ice tends by direct radiation
    to lower the temperature of all surrounding bodies to 32°.</p>

  <p>In Greenland, a country covered with snow and ice, the pitch has been
    seen to melt on the side of a ship exposed to the direct rays of the
    sun, while at the same time the surrounding air was far below the
    freezing-point; a thermometer exposed to the direct radiation of the
    sun has been observed to stand above 100°, while the air surrounding
    the instrument was actually 12° below the freezing-point.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> A similar
    experience has been recorded by travellers on the snow-fields of the
    Alps.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>These results, surprising as they no doubt appear, are what <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>we ought
    to expect under the circumstances. The diathermancy of air has been
    well established by the researches of Professor Tyndall on radiant
    heat. Perfectly dry air seems to be nearly incapable of absorbing
    radiant heat. The entire radiation passes through it almost without any
    sensible absorption. Consequently the pitch on the side of the ship may
    be melted, or the bulb of the thermometer raised to a high temperature
    by the direct rays of the sun, while the surrounding air remains
    intensely cold. “A joint of meat,” says Professor Tyndall, “might be
    roasted before a fire, the air around the joint being cold as ice.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
    The air is cooled by <em>contact</em> with the snow-covered ground, but is not
    heated by the radiation from the sun.</p>

  <p>When the air is humid and charged with aqueous vapour, a similar
    cooling effect also takes place, but in a slightly different way. Air
    charged with aqueous vapour is a good absorber of radiant heat, but
    it can only absorb those rays which agree with it in <em>period</em>. It so
    happens that rays from snow and ice are, of all others, those which it
    absorbs best. The humid air will absorb the total radiation from the
    snow and ice, but it will allow the greater part of, if not nearly all,
    the sun’s rays to pass unabsorbed. But during the day, when the sun is
    shining, the radiation from the snow and ice to the air is negative;
    that is, the snow and ice cool the air by radiation. The result is, the
    air is cooled by radiation from the snow and ice (or rather, we should
    say, <em>to</em> the snow and ice) more rapidly than it is heated by the sun;
    and, as a consequence, in a country like Greenland, covered with an
    icy mantle, the temperature of the air, even during summer, seldom
    rises above the freezing-point. Snow is a good reflector, but as simple
    reflection does not change the character of the rays they would not be
    absorbed by the air, but would pass into stellar space.</p>

  <p>Were it not for the ice, the summers of North Greenland, owing to the
    continuance of the sun above the horizon, would be as warm as those of
    England; but, instead of this, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>Greenland summers are colder than
    our winters. Cover India with an ice sheet, and its summers would be
    colder than those of England.</p>

  <p><em>Second.</em> Another cause of the cooling effect is that the rays which
    fall on snow and ice are to a great extent reflected back into
    space.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But those that are not reflected, but absorbed, do not raise
    the temperature, for they disappear in the mechanical work of melting
    the ice. The latent heat of ice is about 142° F.; consequently in the
    melting of every pound of ice a quantity of heat sufficient to raise
    one pound of water 142° disappears, and is completely lost, so far
    as temperature is concerned. This quantity of heat is consumed, not
    in raising the temperature of the ice, but in the mechanical work of
    tearing the molecules separate against the forces of cohesion binding
    them together into the solid form. No matter what the intensity of the
    sun’s heat may be, the surface of the ground will remain permanently at
    32° so long as the snow and ice continue unmelted. [**P1:missing page
    number]</p>

  <p><em>Third.</em> Snow and ice lower the temperature by chilling the air and
    condensing the vapour into thick fogs. The great strength of the sun’s
    rays during summer, due to his nearness at that season, would, in the
    first place, tend to produce an increased amount of evaporation. But
    the presence of snow-clad mountains and an icy sea would chill the
    atmosphere and condense the vapour into thick fogs. The thick fogs
    and cloudy sky would effectually prevent the sun’s rays from reaching
    the earth, and the snow, in consequence, would remain unmelted during
    the entire summer. In fact, we have this very condition of things
    exemplified in some of the islands of the Southern Ocean at the present
    day. Sandwich Land, which is in the same parallel of latitude as the
    north of Scotland, is covered with ice and snow the entire summer;
    and in the island of South Georgia, which is in the same parallel
    as the centre of England, the perpetual snow descends to the very
    sea-beach. The following is Captain Cook’s description of this dismal
    place:—“We thought it very extraordinary,” he says, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>“that an island
    between the latitudes of 54° and 55° should, in the very height of
    summer, be almost wholly covered with frozen snow, in some places many
    fathoms deep.... The head of the bay was terminated by ice-cliffs of
    considerable height; pieces of which were continually breaking off,
    which made a noise like a cannon. Nor were the interior parts of the
    country less horrible. The savage rocks raised their lofty summits till
    lost in the clouds, and valleys were covered with seemingly perpetual
    snow. Not a tree nor a shrub of any size were to be seen. The only
    signs of vegetation were a strong-bladed grass growing in tufts, wild
    burnet, and a plant-like moss seen on the rocks.... We are inclined to
    think that the interior parts, on account of their elevation, never
    enjoy heat enough to melt the snow in such quantities as to produce
    a river, nor did we find even a stream of fresh water on the whole
    coast.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

  <p>Captain Sir James Ross found the perpetual snow at the sea-level at
    Admiralty Inlet, South Shetland, in lat. 64°; and while near this
    place the thermometer in the very middle of summer fell at night to
    23° F.; and so rapidly was the young ice forming around the ship that
    he began, he says, “to have serious apprehensions of the ships being
    frozen in.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> At the comparatively low latitude of 59° S., in long.
    171° E. (the corresponding latitude of our Orkney Islands), snow was
    falling on the longest day, and the surface of the sea at 32°.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> And
    during the month of February (the month corresponding to August in our
    hemisphere) there were only three days in which they were not assailed
    by snow-showers.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

  <p>In the Straits of Magellan, in 53° S. lat., where the direct heat of
    the sun ought to be as great as in the centre of England, MM. Churrca
    and Galcano have seen snow fall in the middle of summer; and though the
    day was eighteen hours long, the thermometer seldom rose above 42° or
    44°, and never above 51°.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

  <p>This rigorous condition of climate chiefly results from the rays
    of the sun being intercepted by the dense fogs which envelope those
    regions during the entire summer; and the fogs again are due to the
    air being chilled by the presence of the snow-clad mountains and the
    immense masses of floating ice which come from the antarctic seas. The
    reduction of the sun’s heat and lengthening of the winter, which would
    take place when the eccentricity is near to its superior limit and the
    winter in aphelion, would in this country produce a state of things
    perhaps as bad as, if not worse than, that which at present exists in
    South Georgia and South Shetland.</p>

  <p>If we turn our attention to the polar regions, we shall find that
    the cooling effects of snow and ice are even still more marked. The
    coldness of the summers in polar regions is owing almost solely to this
    cause. Captain Scoresby states that, in regard to the arctic regions,
    the general obscurity of the atmosphere arising from fogs or clouds is
    such that the sun is frequently invisible during several successive
    days. At such times, when the sun is near the northern tropic, there is
    scarcely any sensible quantity of light from noon till midnight.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
    “And snow,” he says, “is so common in the arctic regions, that it may
    be boldly stated that in nine days out of ten during the months of
    April, May, and June more or less falls.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

  <p>On the north side of Hudson’s Bay, for example, where the quantity of
    floating ice during summer is enormous, and dense fogs prevail, the
    mean temperature of June does not rise above the freezing-point, being
    actually 13°·5 below the normal temperature; while in some parts of
    Asia under the same latitude, where there is comparatively little ice,
    the mean temperature of June is as high as 60°.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Here the summer is only 2°·4 above the freezing-point.</p>

  <p>The condition of things in the antarctic regions is even still worse
    than in the arctic. Captain Sir James Ross, when between lat. 66° S.
    and 77° 5′ S., during the months of January and February, 1841, found
    the mean temperature to be only 26°·5; and there were only two days
    when it rose even to the freezing-point. When near the ice-barrier on
    the 8th of February, 1841, a season of the year equivalent to August
    in England, he had the thermometer at 12° at noon; and so rapidly was
    the young ice forming around the ships, that it was with difficulty
    that he escaped being frozen in for the winter. “Three days later,”
    he says, “the thick falling snow prevented our seeing to any distance
    before us; the waves as they broke over the ships froze as they fell
    on the decks and rigging, and covered our clothes with a thick coating
    of ice.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> On visiting the barrier next year about the same season,
    he again ran the risk of being frozen in. He states that the surface
    of the sea presented one unbroken sheet of young ice as far as the eye
    could discover from the masthead.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Wilkes, of the American Exploring Expedition, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>says that the
    temperature they experienced in the antarctic regions surprised him,
    for they seldom, if ever, had it above 30°, even at midday. Captain
    Nares, when in latitude 64°S., between the 13th and 25th February last
    (1874), found the mean temperature of the air to be 31°·5; a lower
    temperature than is met with in the arctic regions, in August, ten
    degrees nearer the pole.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

  <p>These extraordinarily low temperatures during summer, which we have
    just been detailing, were due solely to the presence of snow and ice.
    In South Georgia, Sandwich Land, and some other places which we have
    noticed, the summers ought to be about as warm as those of England; yet
    to such an extent is the air cooled by means of floating ice coming
    from the antarctic regions, and the rays of the sun enfeebled by the
    dense fogs which prevail, that there is actually not heat sufficient
    even in the very middle of summer to melt the snow lying on the
    sea-beach.</p>

  <p>We read with astonishment that a country in the latitude of England
    should in the very middle of summer be covered with snow down to the
    sea-shore—the thermometer seldom rising much above the freezing-point.
    But we do not consider it so surprising that the summer temperature of
    the polar regions should be low, for we are accustomed to regard a low
    temperature as the normal condition of things there. We are, however,
    mistaken if we suppose that the influence of ice on climate is less
    marked at the poles than at such places as South Georgia or Sandwich
    Land.</p>

  <p>It is true that a low summer temperature is the normal state of
    matters in very high latitudes, but it is so only in consequence of
    the perpetual presence of snow and ice. When we speak of the normal
    temperature of a place we mean, of course, as we have already seen,
    the normal temperature under the present condition of things. But
    were the ice removed from those regions, our present Tables of normal
    summer temperature would be valueless. These Tables give us the normal
    June temperature while the ice remains, but they do not afford us <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>the
    least idea as to what that temperature would be were the ice removed.
    The mere removal of the ice, all things else remaining the same, would
    raise the summer temperature enormously. The actual June temperature of
    Melville Island, for example, is 37°, and Port Franklin, Nova Zembla,
    36°·5; but were the ice removed from the arctic regions, we should
    then find that the summer temperature of those places would be about
    as high as that of England. This will be evident from the following
    considerations:—</p>

  <p>The temperature of a place, other things being equal, is proportionate
    to the quantity of heat received from the sun. If Greenland receives
    per given surface as much heat from the sun as England, its temperature
    ought to be as high as that of England. Now, from May 10 till August
    3, a period of eighty-five days, the quantity of heat received from
    the sun in consequence of his remaining above the horizon is actually
    greater at the north pole than at the equator.</p>

  <p>Column II. of the following Table, calculated by Mr. Meech,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
    represents the quantity of heat received from the sun on the 15th of
    June at every 10° of latitude. To simplify the Table, I have taken 100
    as the unit quantity received at the equator on that day instead of the
    unit adopted by Mr. Meech:—</p>

  <p>The calculations are, of course, made upon the supposition that the
    quantity of rays cut off in passing through the atmosphere <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>is the
    same at the poles as at the equator, which, as we know, is not exactly
    the case. But, notwithstanding the extra loss of solar heat in high
    latitudes caused by the greater amount of rays that are cut off, still,
    if the temperature of the arctic summers were at all proportionate to
    the quantity of heat received from the sun, it ought to be very much
    higher than it actually is. Column III. represents the actual mean June
    temperature, according to Prof. Dove, at the corresponding latitudes.
    A comparison of these two columns will show the very great deficiency
    of temperature in high latitudes during summer. At the equator, for
    example, the quantity of heat received is represented by 100 and the
    temperature 80°; while at the pole the temperature is only 27°·4,
    although the amount of heat received is 136. This low temperature
    during summer, from what has been already shown, is due chiefly to the
    presence of snow and ice. If by some means or other we could remove
    the snow and ice from the arctic regions, they would then enjoy a
    temperate, if not a hot, summer. In Greenland, as we have already seen,
    snow falls even in the very middle of summer, more or less, nine days
    out of ten; but remove the snow from the northern hemisphere, and a
    snow-shower in Greenland during summer would be as great a rarity as it
    would be on the plains of India.</p>

  <p>Other things being equal, the quantity of solar heat received in
    Greenland during summer is considerably greater than in England.
    Consequently, were it not for snow and ice, it would enjoy as warm a
    climate during summer as that of England. Conversely, let the polar
    snow and ice extend to the latitude of England, and the summers of that
    country would be as cold as those of Greenland. Our summers would then
    be as cold as our winters are at present, and snow in the very middle
    of summer would perhaps be as common as rain.</p>

  <p><em>Mr. Murphy’s Theory.</em>—In a paper read before the Geological Society
    by Mr. Murphy<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> he admits that the glacial climate was due to an
    increase of eccentricity, but maintains in opposition to me that the
    glaciated hemisphere must be that in which the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span><em>summer</em> occurs in
    <em>aphelion</em> during the greatest eccentricity of the earth’s orbit.</p>

  <p>I fear that Mr. Murphy must be resting his theory on the mistaken idea
    that a summer in aphelion ought to melt less snow and ice than one in
    perihelion. It is quite true that the longer summer in aphelion—other
    things being equal—is colder than the shorter one in perihelion, but
    the quantity of heat received from the sun is the same in both cases.
    Consequently the quantity of snow and ice melted ought also to be the
    same; for the amount melted is in proportion to the quantity of energy
    in the form of heat received.</p>

  <p>It is true that with us at present less snow and ice are melted during
    a cold summer than during a warm one. But this is not a case in point,
    for during a cold summer we have less heat than during a warm summer,
    the length of both being the same. The coldness of the summers in
    this case is owing chiefly to a portion of the heat which we ought to
    receive from the sun being cut off by some obstructing cause.</p>

  <p>The reason why we have so little snow, and consequently so little ice,
    in temperate regions, is not, as Mr. Murphy seems to suppose, that
    the heat of summer melts it all, but that there is so little to melt.
    And the reason why we have so little to melt is that, owing to the
    warmth of our winters, we have generally rain instead of snow. But
    if you increase the eccentricity very much, and place the winter in
    perihelion, we should probably have no snow whatever, and, as far as
    glaciation is concerned, it would then matter very little what sort of
    summer we had.</p>

  <p>But it is not correct to say that the perihelion summer of the glacial
    epoch must have been hot. There are physical reasons, as we have just
    seen, which go to prove that, notwithstanding the nearness of the sun
    at that season, the temperature would seldom, if ever, rise much above
    the freezing-point.</p>

  <p>Besides, Mr. Murphy overlooks the fact that the nearness of the sun
    during summer was nearly as essential to the production of the ice, as
    we shall shortly see, as his great distance during winter.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>We must now proceed to the consideration of an agency which is brought
    into operation by the foregoing condition of things, an agency far
    more potent than any which has yet come under our notice, viz., the
    <em>Deflection of Ocean-currents</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Deflection of Ocean-currents the chief Cause of secular Changes
    of Climate.</em>—The enormous extent to which the thermal condition of
    the globe is affected by ocean-currents seems to cast new light on
    the mystery of geological climate. What, for example, would be the
    condition of Europe were the Gulf-stream stopped, and the Atlantic thus
    deprived of one-fifth of the absolute amount of heat which it is now
    receiving above what it has in virtue of the temperature of space? If
    the results just arrived at be at all justifiable, it follows that the
    stoppage of the stream would lower the temperature of northern Europe
    to an extent that would induce a condition of climate as severe as that
    of North Greenland; and were the warm currents of the North Pacific
    also at the same time to be stopped, the northern hemisphere would
    assuredly be subjected to a state of general glaciation.</p>

  <p>Suppose also that the warm currents, having been withdrawn from the
    northern hemisphere, should flow into the Southern Ocean: what then
    would be the condition of the southern hemisphere? Such a transference
    of heat would raise the temperature of the latter hemisphere about
    as much as it would lower the temperature of the former. It would
    consequently raise the mean temperature of the antarctic regions much
    above the freezing-point, and the ice under which those regions are
    at present buried would, to a great extent at least, disappear. The
    northern hemisphere, thus deprived of the heat from the equator, would
    be under a condition of things similar to that which prevailed during
    the glacial epoch; while the other hemisphere, receiving the heat from
    the equator, would be under a condition of climate similar to what we
    know prevailed in the northern hemisphere during a part of the Upper
    Miocene period, when North Greenland enjoyed a climate as mild as that
    of England at the present day.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

  <p>This is no mere picture of the imagination, no mere hypothesis devised
    to meet a difficult case; for if what has already been stated be not
    completely erroneous, all this follows as a necessary consequence from
    physical principles. If the warm currents of the equatorial regions
    be all deflected into one hemisphere, such must be the condition of
    things. How then do the agencies which we have been considering deflect
    ocean-currents?</p>

  <p><em>How the foregoing Causes deflect Ocean-currents.</em>—A high condition
    of eccentricity tends, we have seen, to produce an accumulation of
    snow and ice on the hemisphere whose winters occur in aphelion. This
    accumulation tends in turn to lower the summer temperature, to cut
    off the sun’s rays, and so to retard the melting of the snow. In
    short, it tends to produce on that hemisphere a state of glaciation.
    Exactly opposite effects take place on the other hemisphere, which
    has its winter in perihelion. There the shortness of the winters and
    the highness of the temperature, owing to the sun’s nearness, combine
    to prevent the accumulation of snow. The general result is that the
    one hemisphere is cooled and the other heated. This state of things
    now brings into play the agencies which lead to the deflection of the
    Gulf-stream and other great ocean-currents.</p>

  <p>Owing to the great difference between the temperature of the equator
    and the poles, there is a constant flow of air from the poles to the
    equator. It is to this that the trade-winds owe their existence. Now as
    the strength of these winds, as a general rule, will depend upon the
    difference of temperature that may exist between the equator and higher
    latitudes, it follows that the trades on the cold hemisphere will be
    stronger than those on the warm. When the polar and temperate regions
    of the one hemisphere are covered to a large extent with snow and ice,
    the air, as we have just seen, is kept almost at the freezing-point
    during both summer and winter. The trades on that hemisphere will, of
    necessity, be exceedingly powerful; while on the other hemisphere,
    where there is comparatively little snow and ice, and the air is warm,
    the trades will, as a consequence, be weak. Suppose now the northern
    hemisphere to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> the cold one. The north-east trade-winds of this
    hemisphere will far exceed in strength the south-east trade-winds of
    the southern hemisphere. The <em>median-line</em> between the trades will
    consequently lie to a very considerable distance to the south of
    the equator. We have a good example of this at the present day. The
    difference of temperature between the two hemispheres at present is
    but trifling to what it would be in the case under consideration; yet
    we find that the south-east trades of the Atlantic blow with greater
    force than the north-east trades, and the result is that the south-east
    trades sometimes extend to 10° or 15° N. lat., whereas the north-east
    trades seldom blow south of the equator. The effect of the northern
    trades blowing across the equator to a great distance will be to impel
    the warm water of the tropics over into the Southern Ocean. But this
    is not all; not only would the median-line of the trades be shifted
    southwards, but the great equatorial currents of the globe would also
    be shifted southwards.</p>

  <p>Let us now consider how this would affect the Gulf-stream. The South
    American continent is shaped somewhat in the form of a triangle, with
    one of its angular corners, called Cape St. Roque, pointing eastwards.
    The equatorial current of the Atlantic impinges against this corner;
    but as the greater portion of the current lies a little to the north
    of the corner, it flows westward into the Gulf of Mexico and forms the
    Gulf-stream. A considerable portion of the water, however, strikes the
    land to the south of the Cape and is deflected along the shores of
    Brazil into the Southern Ocean, forming what is known as the Brazilian
    current.</p>

  <p>Now it is perfectly obvious that the shifting of the equatorial
    current of the Atlantic only a few degrees to the south of its present
    position—a thing which would certainly take place under the conditions
    which we have been detailing—would turn the entire current into the
    Brazilian branch, and instead of flowing chiefly into the Gulf of
    Mexico as at present, it would all flow into the Southern Ocean, and
    the Gulf-stream would consequently be stopped. The stoppage of the
    Gulf-stream, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>combined with all those causes which we have just been
    considering, would place Europe under glacial conditions; while, at the
    same time, the temperature of the Southern Ocean would, in consequence
    of the enormous quantity of warm water received, have its temperature
    (already high from other causes) raised enormously.</p>

  <p><em>Deflection of the Gulf-stream during the Glacial Epoch indicated by
    the Difference between the Clyde and Canadian Shell-beds.</em>—That the
    glaciation of north-western Europe resulted to a great extent from
    the stoppage of the Gulf-stream may, I think, be inferred from a
    circumstance pointed out by the Rev. Mr. Crosskey, several years ago,
    in a paper read before the Glasgow Geological Society.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He showed
    that the difference between the glacial shells of Canada and those
    now existing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is much less marked than the
    difference between the glacial shells of the Clyde beds and those now
    existing in the Firth. And from this he justly infers that the change
    of climate in Canada since the glacial epoch has been far less complete
    than in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The return of the Gulf-stream has raised the mean annual temperature of
    our island no less than 15° above the normal, while Canada, deprived of
    its influence and exposed to a cold stream from polar regions, has been
    kept nearly as much below the normal.</p>

  <p>Let us compare the present temperature of the two countries. In making
    our comparison we must, of course, compare places on the same latitude.
    It will not do, for example, to compare Glasgow with Montreal or
    Quebec, places on the latitude of the south of France and north of
    Italy. It will be found that the difference of temperature between
    the two countries is so enormous as to appear scarcely credible to
    those who have not examined the matter. The temperatures have all been
    taken from Professor Dove’s work on the “Distribution of Heat over the
    Surface of the Globe,” and his Tables published in the Report of the
    British Association for 1847.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

  <p>The mean temperature of Scotland for January is about 38° F., while
    in some parts of Labrador, on the same latitude, and all along the
    central parts of North America lying to the north of Upper Canada,
    it is actually 10°, and in many places 13° below zero. The January
    temperature at the Cumberland House, which is situated on the latitude
    of the centre of England, is more than 13° below zero. Here is a
    difference of no less than 51°. The normal temperature for the month
    of January in the latitude of Glasgow, according to Professor Dove, is
    10°. Consequently, owing to the influence of the Gulf-stream, we are
    28° warmer during that month than we would otherwise be, while vast
    tracts of country in America are 23° colder than they should be.</p>

  <p>The July temperature of Glasgow is 61°, while on the same latitude
    in Labrador and places to the west it is only 49°. Glasgow during
    that month is 3° above the normal temperature, while America, owing
    to the influence of the cold polar stream, is 9° below it. The mean
    annual temperature of Glasgow is nearly 50°, while in America, on the
    same latitude, it is only 30°, and in many places as low as 23°. The
    mean normal temperature for the whole year is 35°. Our mean annual
    temperature is therefore 15° above the normal, and that of America from
    5° to 12° below it. The American winters are excessively cold, owing
    to the continental character of the climate, and the absence of any
    benefit from the Gulf-stream, while the summers, which would otherwise
    be warm, are, in the latitude of Glasgow, cooled down to a great extent
    by the cold ice from Greenland; and the consequence is, that the mean
    annual temperature is about 20° or 27° below that of ours. The mean
    annual temperature of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is as low as that of
    Lapland or Iceland. It is no wonder, then, that the shells which
    flourished in Canada during the glacial epoch have not left the gulf
    and the neighbouring seas.</p>

  <p>We have good reason to believe that the climate of America during the
    glacial epoch was even then somewhat more severe than that of Western
    Europe, for the erratics of America extend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> as far south as latitude
    40°, while on the old continent they are not found much beyond latitude
    50°. This difference may have resulted from the fact that the western
    side of a continent is always warmer than the eastern.</p>

  <p>In order to determine whether the cold was as great in America during
    the glacial epoch as in Western Europe, we must not compare the fossils
    found in the glacial beds about Montreal, for example, with those found
    in the Clyde beds, for Montreal lies much further to the south than the
    Clyde. The Clyde beds must be compared with those of Labrador, while
    the beds of Montreal must be compared with those of the south of France
    and the north of Italy, if any are to be found there.</p>

  <p>On the whole, it may be concluded that had the Gulf-stream not returned
    to our shores at the close of the glacial epoch, and had its place
    been supplied by a cold stream from the polar regions, similar to that
    which washes the shores of North America, it is highly probable that
    nearly every species found in our glacial beds would have had their
    representatives flourishing in the British seas at the present day.</p>

  <p>It is no doubt true that when we compare the places in which the
    Canadian shell-beds referred to by Mr. Crosskey are situated with
    places on the same latitude in Europe, the difference of climate
    resulting from the influence of the Gulf-stream is not so great as
    between Scotland and those places which we have been considering; but
    still the difference is sufficiently great to account for why the
    change of climate in Canada has been less complete than in Scotland.</p>

  <p>And what holds true in regard to the currents of the Atlantic holds
    also true, though perhaps not to the same extent, of the currents of
    the Pacific.</p>

  <p><em>Nearness of the Sun in Perigee a Cause of the Accumulation of
    Ice.</em>—But there is still another cause which must be noticed:—A strong
    under current of air <em>from</em> the north implies an equally strong upper
    current <em>to</em> the north. Now if the effect of the under current would
    be to impel the warm water at the equator to the south, the effect
    of the upper current would be to carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> the aqueous vapour formed at
    the equator to the north; the upper current, on reaching the snow and
    ice of temperate regions, would deposit its moisture in the form of
    snow; so that, notwithstanding the great cold of the glacial epoch,
    it is probable that the quantity of snow falling in the northern
    regions would be enormous. This would be particularly the case during
    summer, when the earth would be in the perihelion and the heat at the
    equator great. The equator would be the furnace where evaporation would
    take place, and the snow and ice of temperate regions would act as a
    condenser.</p>

  <p>Heat to produce <em>evaporation</em> is just as essential to the accumulation
    of snow and ice as cold to produce <em>condensation</em>. Now at Midsummer,
    on the supposition of the eccentricity being at its superior limit,
    the sun would be 8,641,870 miles nearer than at present during that
    season. The effect would be that the intensity of the sun’s rays would
    be one-fifth greater than now. That is to say, for every five rays
    received by the ocean at present, six rays would be received then,
    consequently the evaporation during summer would be excessive. But the
    ice-covered land would condense the vapour into snow. It would, no
    doubt, be during summer that the greatest snowfall would take place. In
    fact, the nearness of the sun during that season was as essential to
    the production of the glacial epoch as was his distance during winter.</p>

  <p>The direct effect of eccentricity is to produce on one of the
    hemispheres a long and cold winter. This alone would not lead to a
    condition of things so severe as that which we know prevailed during
    the glacial epoch. But the snow and ice thus produced would bring into
    operation, as we have seen, a host of physical agencies whose combined
    efforts would be quite sufficient to do this.</p>

  <p><em>A remarkable Circumstance regarding those Causes which lead to Secular
    Changes of Climate.</em>—There is one remarkable circumstance connected
    with those physical causes which deserves special notice. They not only
    all lead to one result, viz., an accumulation of snow and ice, but
    they react on one another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> It is quite a common thing in physics for
    the effect to react on the cause. In electricity and magnetism, for
    example, cause and effect in almost every case mutually act and react
    upon each other. But it is usually, if not universally, the case that
    the reaction of the effect tends to weaken the cause. The weakening
    influences of this reaction tend to impose a limit on the efficiency
    of the cause. But, strange to say, in regard to the physical causes
    concerned in the bringing about of the glacial condition of climate,
    cause and effect mutually reacted so as to strengthen each other. And
    this circumstance had a great deal to do with the extraordinary results
    produced.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the accumulation of snow and ice on the ground
    resulting from the long and cold winters tended to cool the air
    and produce fogs which cut off the sun’s rays. The rays thus cut
    off diminished the melting power of the sun, and so increased the
    accumulation. As the snow and ice continued to accumulate, more and
    more of the rays were cut off; and on the other hand, as the rays
    continued to be cut off, the <em>rate</em> of accumulation increased, because
    the quantity of snow and ice melted became thus annually less and less.</p>

  <p>Again, during the long and dreary winters of the glacial epoch the
    earth would be radiating off its heat into space. Had the heat thus
    lost simply gone to lower the temperature, the lowering of the
    temperature would have tended to diminish the rate of loss; but the
    necessary result of this was the formation of snow and ice rather than
    the lowering of temperature.</p>

  <p>And, again, the formation of snow and ice facilitated the rate at which
    the earth lost its heat; and on the other hand, the more rapidly the
    earth parted with its heat, the more rapidly were the snow and ice
    formed.</p>

  <p>Further, as the snow and ice accumulated on the one hemisphere, they
    at the same time continued to diminish on the other. This tended to
    increase the strength of the trade-winds on the cold hemisphere, and
    to weaken those on the warm. The effect of this on ocean currents
    would be to impel the warm water of the tropics more to the warm
    hemisphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> than to the cold. Suppose the northern hemisphere to be
    the cold one, then as the snow and ice began gradually to accumulate
    there, the ocean currents of that hemisphere would begin to decrease in
    volume, while those on the southern, or warm, hemisphere, would <i lang="la">pari
    passu</i> increase. This withdrawal of heat from the northern hemisphere
    would tend, of course, to lower the temperature of that hemisphere
    and thus favour the accumulation of snow and ice. As the snow and ice
    accumulated the ocean currents would decrease, and, on the other hand,
    as the ocean currents diminished the snow and ice would accumulate,—the
    two effects mutually strengthening each other.</p>

  <p>The same must have held true in regard to aërial currents. The more
    the polar and temperate regions became covered with snow and ice, the
    stronger would become the trades and anti-trades of the hemisphere; and
    the stronger those winds became, the greater would be the amount of
    moisture transferred from the tropical regions by the anti-trades to
    the temperate regions; and on the other hand, the more moisture those
    winds brought to temperate regions, the greater would be the quantity
    of snow produced.</p>

  <p>The same process of mutual action and reaction would take place among
    the agencies in operation on the warm hemisphere, only the result
    produced would be diametrically opposite of that produced in the cold
    hemisphere. On this warm hemisphere action and reaction would tend to
    raise the mean temperature and diminish the quantity of snow and ice
    existing in temperate and polar regions.</p>

  <p>Had it been possible for each of those various physical agents which we
    have been considering to produce its direct effects without influencing
    the other agents or being influenced by them, its real efficiency in
    bringing about either the glacial condition of climate or the warm
    condition of climate would not have been so great.</p>

  <p>The primary cause that set all those various physical agencies in
    operation which brought about the glacial epoch, was a high state of
    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. When the eccentricity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> is at a
    high value, snow and ice begin to accumulate, owing to the increasing
    length and coldness of the winter on that hemisphere whose winter
    solstice is approaching toward the aphelion. The accumulating snow
    then begins to bring into operation all the various agencies which
    we have been describing; and, as we have just seen, these, when once
    in full operation, mutually aid one another. As the eccentricity
    increases century by century, the temperate regions become more and
    more covered with snow and ice, first by reason of the continued
    increase in the coldness and length of the winters, and secondly,
    and chiefly, owing to the continued increase in the potency of those
    physical agents which have been called into operation. This glacial
    state of things goes on at an increasing rate, and reaches a maximum
    when the solstice-point arrives at the aphelion. After the solstice
    passes the aphelion, a contrary process commences. The snow and ice
    gradually begin to diminish on the cold hemisphere and to make their
    appearance on the other hemisphere. The glaciated hemisphere turns, by
    degrees, warmer and the warm hemisphere colder, and this continues to
    go on for a period of ten or twelve thousand years, until the winter
    solstice reaches the perihelion. By this time the conditions of the two
    hemispheres have been reversed; the formerly glaciated hemisphere has
    now become the warm one, and the warm hemisphere the glaciated. The
    transference of the ice from the one hemisphere to the other continues
    as long as the eccentricity remains at a high value. This will,
    perhaps, be better understood from an inspection of the frontispiece.</p>

  <p><em>The Mean Temperature of the whole Earth should be greater in Aphelion
    than in Perihelion.</em>—When the eccentricity becomes reduced to about
    its present value, its influence on climate is but little felt.
    It is, however, probable that the present extension of ice on the
    southern hemisphere may, to a considerable extent, be the result of
    eccentricity. The difference in the climatic conditions of the two
    hemispheres is just what should be according to theory:—(1) The mean
    temperature of that hemisphere is less than that of the northern.
    (2) The winters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> of the southern hemisphere are colder than those of
    the northern. (3) The summers, though occurring in perihelion, are
    also comparatively cold; this, as we have seen, is what ought to be
    according to theory. (4) The mean temperature of the whole earth is
    greater in June, when the earth is in aphelion, than in December, when
    it is in perihelion. This, I venture to affirm, is also what ought to
    follow according to theory, although this very fact has been adduced
    as a proof that eccentricity has at present but little effect on the
    climatic condition of our globe.</p>

  <p>That the mean temperature of the whole earth would, during the
    glacial epoch, be greater when the earth was in aphelion than
    when in perihelion will, I think, be apparent from the following
    considerations:—When the earth was in the perihelion, the sun would
    be over the hemisphere nearly covered with snow and ice. The great
    strength of the sun’s rays would in this case have little effect in
    raising the temperature; it would be spent in melting the snow and
    ice. But when the earth was in the aphelion, the sun would be over the
    hemisphere comparatively free, or perhaps wholly free, from snow and
    ice. Consequently, though the intensity of the sun’s rays would be less
    than when the earth was in perihelion, still it ought to have produced
    a higher temperature, because it would be chiefly employed in heating
    the ground and not consumed in melting snow and ice.</p>

  <p><em>Professor Tyndall on the Glacial Epoch.</em>—“So natural,” says Professor
    Tyndall, “was the association of ice and cold, that even celebrated
    men assumed that all that is needed to produce a great extension of
    our glaciers is a diminution of the sun’s temperature. Had they gone
    through the foregoing reflections and calculations, they would probably
    have demanded <em>more</em> heat instead of less for the production of a
    glacial epoch. What they really needed were <em>condensers</em> sufficiently
    powerful to congeal the vapour generated by the heat of the sun.” (<cite>The
    Forms of Water</cite>, p. 154. See also, to the same effect, <cite>Heat Considered
    as a Mode of Motion</cite>, chap. vi.)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

  <p>I do not know to whom Professor Tyndall here refers, but certainly his
    remarks have no application to the theory under consideration, for
    according to it, as we have just seen, the ice of the glacial epoch was
    about as much due to the nearness of the sun in perigee as to his great
    distance in apogee.</p>

  <p>There is one theory, however, to which his remarks justly apply, viz.,
    the theory that the great changes of climate during geological ages
    resulted from the passage of our globe through different temperatures
    of space. What Professor Tyndall says shows plainly that the glacial
    epoch was not brought about by our earth passing through a cold part
    of space. A general reduction of temperature over the whole globe
    certainly would not produce a glacial epoch. Suppose the sun were
    extinguished and our globe exposed to the temperature of stellar space
    (−239° F.), this would certainly freeze the ocean solid from its
    surface to its bottom, but it would not cover the land with ice.</p>

  <p>Professor Tyndall’s conclusions are, of course, equally conclusive
    against Professor Balfour Stewart’s theory, that the glacial epoch may
    have resulted from a general diminution in the intensity of the sun’s
    heat.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless it would be in direct opposition to the well-established
    facts of geology to assume that the ice periods of the glacial epoch
    were warm periods. We are as certain from palæontological evidence
    that the cold was then much greater than now, as we are from physical
    evidence that the accumulation of ice was greater than now. Our glacial
    shell-beds and remains of the mammoth, the reindeer, and musk-ox, tell
    of cold as truly as the markings on the rocks do of ice.</p>

  <p><em>Objection from the Present Condition of the Planet Mars.</em>—It has been
    urged as an objection by Professor Charles Martins<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and others,
    that if a high state of eccentricity could produce a glacial epoch,
    the planet Mars ought to be at present under a glacial condition. The
    eccentricity of its orbit amounts to 0·09322, and one of its southern
    winter solstices is, according to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>Dr. Oudemans, of Batavia,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> within
    17° 41′ 8″ of aphelion. Consequently, it is supposed that one of the
    hemispheres should be in a glacial state and the other free from snow
    and ice. But it is believed that the snow accumulates around each pole
    during its winter and disappears to a great extent during its summer.</p>

  <p>There would be force in this objection were it maintained that
    eccentricity alone can produce a glacial condition of climate, but
    such is not the case, and there is no good ground for concluding that
    those physical agencies which led to the glacial epoch of our globe
    exist in the planet Mars. It is perfectly certain that either water
    must be different in constitution in that planet from what it is in our
    earth, or else its atmospheric envelope must be totally different from
    ours. For it is evident from what has been stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>, that
    were our globe to be removed to the distance of Mars from the sun, the
    lowering of the temperature resulting from the decrease in the sun’s
    heat would not only destroy every living thing, but would convert the
    ocean into solid ice.</p>

  <p>But it must be observed that the eccentricity of Mars’ orbit is at
    present far from its superior limit of 0·14224, and it may so happen in
    the economy of nature that when it approaches to that limit a glacial
    condition of things may supervene.</p>

  <p>The truth is, however, that very little seems to be known with
    certainty regarding the climatic condition of Mars. This is obvious
    from the fact that some astronomers believe that the planet possesses
    a dense atmosphere which protects it from cold; while others maintain
    that its atmosphere is so exceedingly thin that its mean temperature is
    below the freezing-point. Some assert that the climatic condition of
    Mars resembles very much that of our earth, while others affirm that
    its seas are actually frozen solid to the bottom, and the poles covered
    with ice thirty or forty miles in thickness. For reasons which will be
    explained in the Appendix, Mars, notwithstanding its greater distance
    from the sun, may enjoy a climate as warm as that of our earth.</p>

      <span class="small">REASON WHY THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE IS COLDER THAN THE NORTHERN.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subhead">Adhémar’s Explanation.—Adhémar’s Theory founded upon a physical
    Mistake in regard to Radiation.—Professor J. D. Forbes on
    Underground Temperature.—Generally accepted Explanation.—Low
    Temperature of Southern Hemisphere attributed to Preponderance
    of Sea.—Heat transferred from Southern to Northern Hemisphere
    by Ocean-current the true Explanation.—A large Portion of the
    Heat of the Gulf-stream derived from the Southern Hemisphere.</div>

  <p><em>Adhémar’s Explanation.</em>—It has long been known that on the southern
    hemisphere the temperature is lower and the accumulation of ice greater
    than on the northern. This difference has usually been attributed to
    the great preponderance of sea on the southern hemisphere. M. Adhémar,
    on the other hand, attempts to explain this difference by referring it
    to the difference in the amount of heat lost by the two hemispheres
    in consequence of the difference of seven days in the length of their
    respective winters. As the northern winter is shorter than the summer,
    he concludes that there is an accumulation of heat on that hemisphere,
    while, on the other hand, the southern winter being longer than the
    summer, there is therefore a loss of heat on the southern hemisphere.
    “The south pole,” he says, “loses in one year more heat than it
    receives, because the total duration of its night surpasses that of
    its day by 168 hours; and the contrary takes place for the north pole.
    If, for example, we take for unity the mean quantity of heat which the
    sun sends off in one hour, the heat accumulated at the end of the year
    at the north pole will be expressed by 168, while the heat lost by the
    south pole will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> be equal to 168 times what the radiation lessens it by
    in one hour, so that at the end of the year the difference in the heat
    of the two hemispheres will be represented by 336 times what the earth
    receives from the sun or loses in an hour by radiation.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

  <p>Adhémar supposes that about 10,000 years hence, when our northern
    winter will occur in aphelion and the southern in perihelion, the
    climatic conditions of the two hemispheres will be reversed; the
    ice will melt at the south pole, and the northern hemisphere will
    become enveloped in one continuous mass of ice, leagues in thickness,
    extending down to temperate regions.</p>

  <p>This theory seems to be based upon an erroneous interpretation of a
    principle, first pointed out, so far as I am aware, by Humboldt in
    his memoir “On Isothermal Lines and Distribution of Heat over the
    Globe.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This principle may be stated as follows:—</p>

  <p>Although the total quantity of heat received by the earth from the
    sun in one revolution is inversely proportional to the minor axis of
    the orbit, yet this amount, as was proved by D’Alembert, is equally
    distributed between the two hemispheres, whatever the eccentricity may
    be. Whatever extra heat the southern hemisphere may at present receive
    from the sun daily during its summer months owing to greater proximity
    to the sun, is exactly compensated by a corresponding loss arising from
    the shortness of the season; and, on the other hand, whatever daily
    deficiency of heat we in the northern hemisphere may at present have
    during our summer half-year, in consequence of the earth’s distance
    from the sun, is also exactly compensated by a corresponding length of
    season.</p>

  <p>But the surface temperature of our globe depends as much upon the
    amount of heat radiated into space as upon the amount derived from the
    sun, and it has been thought by some that this compensating principle
    holds true only in regard to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>latter. In the case of the heat
    lost by radiation the reverse is supposed to take place. The southern
    hemisphere, it is asserted, has not only a colder winter than the
    northern in consequence of the sun’s greater distance, but it has also
    a longer winter; and the extra loss of heat from radiation during
    winter is not compensated by its nearness to the sun during summer, for
    it gains no additional heat from this proximity. And in the same way it
    is argued that as our winter in the northern hemisphere, owing to the
    less distance of the sun, is not only warmer than that of the southern
    hemisphere, but is also at the same time shorter, so our hemisphere
    is not cooled to such an extent as the southern. And thus the mean
    temperature of the winter half-year, as well as the intensity of the
    sun’s heat, is affected by a change in the sun’s distance.</p>

  <p>Although I always regarded this cause of Humboldt’s to be utterly
    inadequate to produce such effects as those attributed to it by
    Adhémar, still, in my earlier papers<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> I stated it to be a <i lang="la">vera
    causa</i> which ought to produce some sensible effect on climate. But
    shortly afterwards on a more careful consideration of the whole
    subject, I was led to suspect that the circumstance in question can,
    according to theory, produce little or no effect on the climatic
    condition of our globe.</p>

  <p>As there appears to be a considerable amount of misapprehension in
    reference to this point, which forms the basis of Adhémar’s theory, I
    may here give it a brief consideration.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

  <p>The rate at which the earth radiates into space the heat received
    from the sun depends upon the temperature of its surface; and the
    temperature of its surface (other things being equal) depends upon
    the rate at which the heat is received. The greater the rate at which
    the earth receives heat from the sun, the greater will therefore be
    the rate at which it will lose that heat by radiation. Now the total
    quantity of heat received during winter by the southern hemisphere is
    exactly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>equal to that received during winter by the northern. But as
    the southern winter is longer than the northern, the rate at which the
    heat is received, and consequently the rate of radiation, during that
    season must be less on the southern hemisphere than on the northern.
    Thus the southern hemisphere loses heat during a longer period than the
    northern, and therefore the less rate of radiation (were it not for a
    circumstance presently to be noticed) would wholly compensate for the
    longer period, and the total quantity of heat lost during winter would
    be the same on both hemispheres. The southern summer is shorter than
    the northern, but the heat is more intense, and the surface of the
    ground kept at a higher temperature; consequently the rate of radiation
    into space is greater.</p>

  <p>When the rate at which a body receives heat is increased, the
    temperature of the body rises till the rate of radiation equals the
    rate of absorption, after which equilibrium is restored; and when the
    rate of absorption is diminished, the temperature falls till the rate
    of radiation equals that of absorption.</p>

  <p>But notwithstanding all this, owing to the slow conductivity of the
    ground for heat, more heat will pass into it during the longer summer
    of aphelion than during the shorter one of perihelion; for the amount
    of heat which passes into the ground depends on the length of time
    during which the earth is receiving heat, as well as upon the amount
    received. In like manner, more heat will pass out of the ground
    during the longer winter in aphelion than during the shorter one in
    perihelion. Suppose the length of the days on the one hemisphere (say
    the northern) to be 23 hours, and the length of the nights, say one
    hour; while on the other hemisphere the days are one hour and the
    nights 23 hours. Suppose also that the quantity of heat received from
    the sun by the southern hemisphere during the day of one hour to be
    equal to that received by the northern hemisphere during the day of
    23 hours. It is evident that although the surface of the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> on
    the southern hemisphere would receive as much heat from the sun during
    the short day of one hour as the surface of the northern hemisphere
    during the long day of 23 hours, yet, owing to the slow conductivity
    of the ground for heat, the amount absorbed would not be nearly so
    much on the southern hemisphere as on the northern. The temperature
    of the surface during the day, it is true, would be far higher on the
    southern hemisphere than on the northern, and consequently the rate
    at which the heat would pass into the ground would be greater on that
    hemisphere than on the northern; but, notwithstanding the greater rate
    of absorption resulting from the high temperature of the surface, it
    would not compensate for the shortness of the day. On the other hand,
    the surface of the ground on the southern hemisphere would be colder
    during the long night of 23 hours than it would be on the northern
    during the short night of only one hour; and the low temperature of the
    ground would tend to lessen the rate of radiation into space. But the
    decrease in the rate of radiation would not compensate fully for the
    great length of the night. The general and combined result of all those
    causes would be that a slight accumulation of heat would take place on
    the northern hemisphere and a slight loss on the southern. But this
    loss of heat on the one hemisphere and gain on the other would not go
    on accumulating at a uniform rate year by year, as Adhémar supposes.</p>

  <p>Of course we are at present simply considering the earth as an absorber
    and radiator of heat, without taking into account the effects of
    distribution of sea and land and other modifying causes, and are
    assuming that everything is the same in both hemispheres, with the
    exception that the winter of the one hemisphere is longer than that of
    the other.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the amount of heat stored up by the one hemisphere and
    lost by the other? Is it such an amount as to sensibly affect climate?</p>

  <p>The experiments and observations which have been made on underground
    temperature afford us a means of making at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> a rough estimate of
    the amount. And from these it will be seen that the influence of an
    excess of seven or eight days in the length of the southern winter over
    the northern could hardly produce an effect that would be sensible.</p>

  <p>Observations were made at Edinburgh by Professor J. D. Forbes on
    three different substances; viz., sandstone, sand, and trap-rock. By
    calculation, we find from the data afforded by those observations that
    the total quantity of heat accumulated in the ground during the summer
    above the mean temperature was as follows:—In the sandstone-rock, a
    quantity sufficient to raise the temperature of the rock 1° C. to a
    depth of 85 feet 6 inches; in the sand a quantity sufficient to raise
    the temperature 1° C. to a depth of 72 feet 6 inches; and in the
    trap-rock a quantity only sufficient to raise the temperature 1° C. to
    a depth of 61 feet 6 inches.</p>

  <p>Taking the specific heat of the sandstone per unit volume, as
    determined by Regnault, at ·4623, and that of sand at ·3006, and
    trap at ·5283, and reducing all the results to one standard, viz.,
    that of water, we find that the quantity of heat stored up in the
    sandstone would, if applied to water, raise its temperature 1° C. to
    a depth of 39 feet 6 inches; that stored up in the sand would raise
    the temperature of the water 1° C. to a depth of 21 feet 8 inches, and
    that stored up in the trap would raise the water 1° C. to the depth
    of 32 feet 6 inches. We may take the mean of these three results as
    representing pretty accurately the quantity stored up in the general
    surface of the country. This would be equal to 31 feet 3 inches depth
    of water raised 1° C. The quantity of heat lost by radiation during
    winter below the mean was found to be about equal to that stored up
    during summer.</p>

  <p>The total quantity of heat per square foot of surface received by the
    equator from sunrise till sunset at the time of the equinoxes, allowing
    22 per cent. for the amount cut off in passing through the atmosphere,
    is 1,780,474 foot-pounds. In the latitude of Edinburgh about 938,460
    foot-pounds per square foot of surface is received, assuming that not
    more than 22 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> cent. is cut off by the atmosphere. At this rate a
    quantity of heat would be received from the sun in two days ten hours
    (say, three days) sufficient to raise the temperature of the water 1°
    C. to the required depth of 31 feet 3 inches. Consequently the total
    quantity of heat stored up during summer in the latitude of Edinburgh
    is only equal to what we receive from the sun during three days at the
    time of the equinoxes. Three days’ sunshine during the middle of March
    or September, if applied to raise the temperature of the ground, would
    restore all the heat lost during the entire winter; and another three
    days’ sunshine would confer on the ground as much heat as is stored
    up during the entire summer. But it must be observed that the total
    duration of sunshine in winter is to that of summer in the latitude of
    Edinburgh only about as 4 to 7. Here is a difference of two months.
    But this is not all; the quantity of heat received during winter is
    scarcely one-third of that received during summer; yet, notwithstanding
    this enormous difference between summer and winter, the ground during
    winter loses only about six days’ sun-heat below the maximum amount
    possessed by it in summer.</p>

  <p>But if what has already been stated is correct, this loss of heat
    sustained by the earth during winter is not chiefly owing to radiation
    during the longer absence of the sun, but to the decrease in the
    quantity of heat received in consequence of his longer absence combined
    with the obliquity of his rays during that season. Now in the case
    of the two hemispheres, although the southern winter is longer than
    the northern, yet the quantity of heat received by each is the same.
    But supposing it held true, which it does not, that the loss of
    heat sustained by the earth in winter is as much owing to radiation
    resulting from the excess in the length of the winter nights over those
    of the summer as to the deficiency of heat received in winter from that
    received in summer, three days’ heat would then in this case be the
    amount lost by radiation in consequence of this excess in the length of
    the winter nights. The total length of the winter nights to those of
    the summer is, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> have seen, about as 7 to 4. This is a difference
    of nearly 1200 hours. But the excess of the south polar winter over the
    north amounts to only about 184 hours. Now if 1200 hours give a loss of
    three days’ sun-heat, 184 hours will give a loss of scarcely 5½ hours.</p>

  <p>It is no doubt true that the two cases are not exactly analogous; but
    it is obvious that any error which can possibly arise from regarding
    them as such cannot materially alter the conclusion to which we have
    arrived. Supposing the effect were double, or even quadruple, what
    we have concluded it to be, still it would not amount to a loss of
    two days’ heat, which could certainly have little or no influence on
    climate.</p>

  <p>But even assuming all the preceding reasoning to be incorrect, and that
    the southern hemisphere, in consequence of its longer winter, loses
    heat to the extravagant extent of 168 hours, supposed by Adhémar, still
    this could not materially affect climate. The climate is influenced
    by the mere <em>temperature</em> of the <em>surface</em> of the ground, and not by
    the quantity of heat or cold that may be stored up under the surface.
    The climate is determined, so far as the ground is concerned, by
    the temperature of the surface, and is wholly independent of the
    temperature which may exist under the surface. Underground temperature
    can only affect climate through the surface. If the surface could,
    for example, be kept covered with perpetual snow, we should have a
    cold and sterile climate, although the temperature of the ground under
    the snow was actually at the boiling-point. Let the ground to a depth
    of, say 40 or 50 feet, be deprived of an amount of heat equal to that
    received from the sun in 168 hours. This could produce little or no
    sensible effect on climate; for, owing to the slow conductivity of the
    ground for heat, this loss would not sensibly affect the temperature
    of the surface, as it would take several months for the sun’s heat
    to penetrate to that depth and restore the lost heat. The cold, if I
    may be allowed to use the expression, would come so slowly out to the
    surface that its effect in lowering the temperature of the surface
    would scarcely be sensible. And, again, if we suppose the 168 hours’
    heat to be lost by the mere surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> ground, the effect would
    certainly be sensible, but it would only be so for a few days. We
    might in this case have a week’s frozen soil, but that would be all.
    Before the air had time to become very sensibly affected by the low
    temperature of the surface the frozen soil would be thawed.</p>

  <p>The storing up of heat or cold in the ground has in reality very little
    to do with climate. Some physicists explain, for example, why the month
    of July is warmer than June by referring it to the fact that by the
    month of July the ground has become possessed of a larger accumulation
    of heat than it possessed in June. This explanation is evidently
    erroneous. The ground in July certainly possesses a greater store of
    heat than it did in June; but this is not the reason why the former
    month is hotter than the latter. July is hotter than June because the
    <em>air</em> (not the <em>ground</em>) has become possessed of a larger store of
    heat than it had in June. Now the air is warmer in July than in June
    because, receiving little increase of temperature from the direct rays
    of the sun, it is heated chiefly by radiation from the earth and by
    contact with its warm surface. Consequently, although the sun’s heat
    is greater in June than it is in July, it is near the middle of July
    before the air becomes possessed of its maximum store of heat. We
    therefore say that July is hotter than June because the air is hotter,
    and consequently the temperature in the shade is greater in the former
    month than in the latter.</p>

  <p>It is therefore, I presume, quite apparent that Adhémar’s theory fails
    to explain why the southern hemisphere is colder than the northern.</p>

  <p><em>The generally accepted Explanation.</em>—The difference in the mean
    temperature of the two hemispheres is usually attributed to the
    proportion of sea to land in the southern hemisphere and of land to
    sea in the northern hemisphere. This, no doubt, will account for the
    greater <em>annual range</em> of temperature on the northern hemisphere,
    but it seems to me that it will not account for the excess of <em>mean</em>
    temperature possessed by that hemisphere over the southern.</p>

  <p>The general influence of land on climate is to exaggerate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
    variation of temperature due to the seasons. On continents the summers
    are hotter and the winters colder than on the ocean. The days are
    also hotter and the nights colder on land than on sea. This is a
    result which follows from the mere physical properties of land and
    water, independently of currents, whether of ocean or of air. But it
    nevertheless follows, according to theory (and this is a point which
    has been overlooked), that the mean annual temperature of the ocean
    ought to be greater than that of the land in equatorial regions as
    well as in temperate and polar regions. This will appear obvious for
    the following reasons:—(1) The ground stores up heat only by the slow
    process of conduction, whereas water, by the mobility of its particles
    and its transparency for heat-rays, especially those from the sun,
    becomes heated to a considerable depth rapidly. The quantity of heat
    stored up in the ground is thus comparatively small, while the quantity
    stored up in the ocean is great. (2) The air is probably heated more
    rapidly by contact with the ground than with the ocean; but, on the
    other hand, it is heated far more rapidly by radiation from the ocean
    than from the land. The aqueous vapour of the air is to a great extent
    diathermanous to radiation from the ground, while it absorbs the
    rays from water and thus becomes heated. (3) The air radiates back a
    considerable portion of its heat, and the ocean absorbs this radiation
    from the air more readily than the ground does. The ocean will not
    reflect the heat from the aqueous vapour of the air, but absorbs it,
    while the ground does the opposite. Radiation from the air, therefore,
    tends more readily to heat the ocean than it does the land. (4) The
    aqueous vapour of the air acts as a screen to prevent the loss by
    radiation from water, while it allows radiation from the ground to pass
    more freely into space; the atmosphere over the ocean consequently
    throws back a greater amount of heat than is thrown back by the
    atmosphere over the land. The sea in this case has a much greater
    difficulty than the land has in getting quit of the heat received from
    the sun; in other words, the land tends to lose its heat more rapidly
    than the sea. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> consequence of all these circumstances is that the
    ocean must stand at a higher mean temperature than the land. A state of
    equilibrium is never gained until the rate at which a body is receiving
    heat is equal to the rate at which it is losing it; but as equal
    surfaces of sea and land receive from the sun the same amount of heat,
    it therefore follows that, in order that the sea may get quit of its
    heat as rapidly as the land, it <em>must stand at a higher temperature</em>
    than the land. The temperature of the sea must continue to rise till
    the amount of heat thrown off into space equals that received from the
    sun; when this point is reached, equilibrium is established and the
    temperature remains stationary. But, owing to the greater difficulty
    that the sea has in getting rid of its heat, the mean temperature
    of equilibrium of the ocean must be higher than that of the land;
    consequently the mean temperature of the ocean, and also of the air
    immediately over it, in tropical regions should be higher than the mean
    temperature of the land and the air over it.</p>

  <p>The greater portion of the southern hemisphere, however, is occupied by
    water, and why then, it may be asked, is this water hemisphere colder
    than the land hemisphere? Ought it not also to follow that the sea in
    inter-tropical regions should be warmer than the land under the same
    parallels; yet, as we know, the reverse is actually found to be the
    case. How then is all this to be explained, if the foregoing reasoning
    be correct? We find when we examine Professor Dove’s charts of mean
    annual temperature, that the ocean in inter-tropical regions has a
    mean annual temperature below the normal, and the land a mean annual
    temperature above the normal. Both in the Pacific and in the Atlantic
    the mean temperature sinks to 2°·3 below the normal, while on the
    land it rises 4°·6 above the normal. The explanation in this case is
    obviously this: the temperature of the ocean in inter-tropical regions,
    as we have already seen, is kept much lower than it would otherwise be
    by the enormous amount of <em>heat</em> that is being constantly carried away
    from those regions into temperate and polar regions, and of <em>cold</em> that
    is being constantly carried from temperate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> polar regions to the
    tropical regions by means of ocean-currents. The same principle which
    explains why the sea in inter-tropical regions has a lower mean annual
    temperature than the land, explains also why the southern hemisphere
    has a lower mean annual temperature than the northern. The temperature
    of the southern hemisphere is lowered by the transference of heat by
    means of ocean-currents.</p>

  <p><em>Heat transferred from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere by
    Ocean-currents the true Explanation.</em>—The great ocean-currents of
    the globe take their rise in three immense streams from the Southern
    Ocean, which, on reaching the tropical regions, become deflected in
    a westerly direction and flow along the southern side of the equator
    for thousands of miles. Perhaps more than one half of this mass of
    moving water returns into the Southern Ocean without ever crossing the
    equator, but the quantity which crosses over to the northern hemisphere
    is enormous. This constant flow of water from the southern hemisphere
    to the northern in the form of surface currents must be compensated by
    <em>under currents</em> of equal magnitude from the northern hemisphere to the
    southern. The currents, however, which cross the equator are far higher
    in temperature than their compensating under currents; consequently
    there is a constant transference of heat from the southern hemisphere
    to the northern. Any currents taking their rise in the northern
    hemisphere and flowing across into the southern are comparatively
    trifling, and the amount of heat transferred by them is also trifling.
    There are one or two currents of considerable size, such as the
    Brazilian branch of the great equatorial current of the Atlantic, and
    a part of the South Equatorial Drift-current of the Pacific, which
    cross the equator from north to south; but these cannot be regarded as
    northern currents; they are simply southern currents deflected back
    after crossing over to the northern hemisphere. The heat which these
    currents possess is chiefly obtained on the southern hemisphere before
    crossing over to the northern; and although the northern hemisphere may
    not gain much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> heat by means of them, it, on the other hand, does not
    lose much, for the heat which they give out in their progress along the
    southern hemisphere does not belong to the northern hemisphere.</p>

  <p>But, after making the fullest allowance for the amount of heat carried
    across the equator from the northern hemisphere to the southern, we
    shall find, if we compare the mean temperature of the currents from
    south to north with that of the great compensating under currents and
    the one or two small surface currents, that the former is very much
    higher than the latter. The mean temperature of the water crossing the
    equator from south to north is probably not under 65°, that of the
    under currents is probably not over 39°. But to the under currents
    we must add the surface currents from north to south; and assuming
    that this will raise the mean temperature of the entire mass of water
    flowing south to, say, 45°, we have still a difference of 20° between
    the temperature of the masses flowing north and south. Each cubic
    foot of water which crosses the equator will in this case transfer
    about 965,000 foot-pounds of heat from the southern hemisphere to the
    northern. If we had any means of ascertaining the volume of those great
    currents crossing the equator, we should then be able to make a rough
    estimate of the total amount of heat transferred from the southern
    hemisphere to the northern; but as yet no accurate estimate has been
    made on this point. Let us assume, what is probably below the truth,
    that the total amount of water crossing the equator is at least double
    that of the Gulf-stream as it passes through the Straits of Florida,
    which amount we have already found to be equal to 66,908,160,000,000
    cubic feet daily. Taking the quantity of heat conveyed by each cubic
    foot of water of the Gulf-stream as 1,158,000 foot-pounds, it is
    found, as we have seen, that an amount of heat is conveyed by this
    current equal to all the heat that falls within 32 miles on each
    side of the equator. Then, if each cubic foot of water crossing the
    equator transfers 965,000 foot-pounds, and the quantity of water be
    double that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> of the Gulf-stream, it follows that the amount of heat
    transferred from the southern hemisphere to the northern is equal to
    all the heat falling within 52 miles on each side of the equator, or
    equal to all the heat falling on the southern hemisphere within 104
    miles of the equator. This quantity taken from the southern hemisphere
    and added to the northern will therefore make a difference in the
    amount of heat possessed by the two hemispheres equal to all the heat
    which falls on the southern hemisphere within somewhat more than 208
    miles of the equator.</p>

  <p><em>A large Portion of the Heat of the Gulf-stream derived from the
    Southern Hemisphere.</em>—It can be proved that a very large portion of the
    heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream comes from the southern hemisphere.
    The proof is as follows:—</p>

  <p>If all the heat came from the northern hemisphere, it could only come
    from that portion of the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico
    which lies to the north of the equator. The entire area of these seas,
    extending to the Tropic of Cancer, is about 7,700,000 square miles.
    But this area is not sufficient to supply the current passing through
    the “Narrows” with the necessary heat. Were the heat which passes
    through the Straits of Florida derived exclusively from this area, the
    following table would then represent the relative quantity per unit
    surface possessed by the Atlantic in the three zones, assuming that one
    half of the heat of the Gulf-stream passes into the arctic regions and
    the other half remains to warm the temperate regions<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>:—</p>

  <table summary="Heat per unit surface">
    <tbody>

  <p class="noindent">These figures show that the Atlantic, from the equator to the Tropic
    of Cancer, would be as cold as from the Tropic of Cancer to the North
    Pole, were it not that a large proportion of the heat possessed by the
    Gulf-stream is derived from the southern hemisphere.</p>

    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subhead">Introduction.—Ocean-currents, according to Maury, due to
    Difference of Specific Gravity.—Difference of Specific Gravity
    resulting from Difference of Temperature.—Difference of
    Specific Gravity resulting from Difference of Saltness.—Maury’s
    two Causes neutralize each other.—How, according to him,
    Difference in Saltness acts as a Cause.</div>

  <p><em>Introduction.</em>—Few subjects have excited more interest and attention
    than the cause of ocean circulation; and yet few are in a more
    imperfect and unsatisfactory condition, nor is there any question
    regarding which a greater diversity of opinion has prevailed. Our
    incomplete acquaintance with the facts relating to the currents of the
    ocean and the modes of circulation actually in operation, is no doubt
    one reason for this state of things. But doubtless the principal cause
    of such diversity of opinion lies in the fact that the question is one
    which properly belongs to the domain of physics and mechanics, while
    as yet no physicist of note (if we except Dr. Colding, of Copenhagen)
    has given, as far as I know, any special attention to the subject. It
    is true that in works of meteorology and physical geography reference
    is continually made to such eminent physicists as Herschel, Pouillet,
    Buff, and others; but when we turn to the writings of these authors we
    find merely a few remarks expressive of their opinions on the subject,
    and no special discussion or investigation of the matter, nor anything
    which could warrant us in concluding that such investigations have ever
    been made. At present the question cannot be decided by a reference to
    authorities.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

  <p>The various theories on the subject may be classed under two divisions;
    the first of these attributes the motion of the water to the <em>impulse
    of the wind</em>, and the second to the <em>force of gravity</em> resulting from
    difference of density. But even amongst those who adopt the former
    theory, it is generally held that the winds are not the sole cause,
    but that, to a certain extent at least, difference of specific gravity
    contributes to produce motion of the waters. This is a very natural
    conclusion; and in the present state of physical geography on this
    subject one can hardly be expected to hold any other view.</p>

  <p>The supporters of the latter theory may be subdivided into two
    classes. The first of these (of which Maury may be regarded as the
    representative) attributes the Gulf-stream, and other sensible currents
    of the ocean, to difference of specific gravity. The other class (at
    present the more popular of the two, and of which Dr. Carpenter may be
    considered the representative) denies altogether that such currents can
    be produced by difference of specific gravity,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and affirms that
    there is a general movement of the upper portion of the ocean from the
    equator to the poles, and a counter-movement of the under portion from
    the poles to the equator. This movement is attributed to difference of
    specific gravity between equatorial and polar water, resulting from
    difference of temperature.</p>

  <p>The widespread popularity of the gravitation theory is no doubt, to a
    great extent, owing to the very great prominence given to it by Lieut.
    Maury in his interesting and popular work, “The Physical Geography of
    the Sea.” Another cause which must have favoured the reception of this
    theory is the ease with which it is perceived how, according to it,
    circulation of the waters of the ocean is supposed to follow. One has
    no difficulty, for example, in perceiving that if the inter-tropical
    waters of the ocean are expanded by heat, and the waters around the
    poles contracted by cold, the surface of the ocean will stand at a
    higher level at the equator than at the poles. Equilibrium being
    thus disturbed, the water at the equator <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>will tend to flow towards
    the poles as a surface current, and the water at the poles towards
    the equator as an under current. This, at first sight, looks well,
    especially to those who take but a superficial view of the matter.</p>

  <p>We shall examine this theory at some length, for two reasons: 1,
    because it lies at the root of a great deal of the confusion and
    misconception which have prevailed in regard to the whole subject of
    ocean-currents: 2, because, if the theory is correct, it militates
    strongly against the physical theory of secular changes of climate
    advanced in this volume. We have already seen (<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>) that
    when the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit reaches a high value, a
    combination of physical circumstances tends to lower the temperature of
    the hemisphere which has its winter solstice in aphelion, and to raise
    the temperature of the opposite hemisphere, whose winter solstice will,
    of course, be in perihelion. The direct result of this state of things,
    as was shown, is to strengthen the force of the trade-winds on the
    cold hemisphere, and to weaken their strength on the warm hemisphere:
    and this, in turn, we also saw, tends to impel the warm water of
    the inter-tropical region on to the warm hemisphere, and to prevent
    it, in a very large degree, from passing into the cold hemisphere.
    This deflection of the ocean-currents tends to an enormous extent to
    increase the difference of temperature previously existing between the
    two hemispheres. In other words, the warm and equable condition of the
    one hemisphere, and the cold and glacial condition of the other, are,
    to a great extent, due to this deflection of ocean-currents. But if
    the theory be correct which attributes the motion of ocean-currents to
    a difference in density between the sea in inter-tropical and polar
    regions, then it follows that these currents (other things being
    equal) ought to be stronger on the cold hemisphere than on the warm,
    because there is a greater difference of temperature and, consequently,
    a greater difference of density, between the polar seas of the cold
    hemisphere and the equatorial seas, than between the polar seas of the
    warm hemisphere and the equatorial seas. And this being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> the case,
    notwithstanding the influence of the trade-winds of the cold hemisphere
    blowing over upon the warm, the currents will, in all probability,
    be stronger on the cold hemisphere than on the warm. In other words,
    the influence of the powerful trade-winds of the cold hemisphere to
    transfer the warm water of the equator to the warm hemisphere will
    probably be more than counterbalanced by the tendency of the warm
    and buoyant waters of the equator to flow towards the dense and cold
    waters around the pole of the cold hemisphere. But if ocean-currents
    are due not to difference in specific gravity, but to the influence of
    the winds, then it is evident that the waters at the equator will be
    impelled, not into the cold hemisphere, but into the warm.</p>

  <p>For this reason I have been the more anxious to prove that
    inter-tropical heat is conveyed to temperate and polar regions by
    ocean-currents, and not by means of any general movement of the ocean
    resulting from difference of gravity. I shall therefore on this account
    enter more fully into this part of the subject than I otherwise would
    have done. Irrespective of all this, however, the important nature of
    the whole question, and the very general interest it excites, warrant a
    full consideration of the subject.</p>

  <p>I shall consider first that form of the gravitation theory advocated
    by Maury in his work on the “Physical Geography of the Sea,” which
    attributes the motion of the Gulf-stream and other sensible currents
    of the ocean to differences of specific gravity. One reason which has
    induced me to select Maury’s work is, that it not only contains a much
    fuller discussion on the cause of the motion of ocean-currents than is
    to be found anywhere else, but also that it has probably passed through
    a greater number of editions than any other book of a scientific
    character in the English language in the same length of time.</p>

  <p><em>Examination of Lieut. Maury’s Gravitation Theory.</em>—Although Lieut.
    Maury has expounded his views on the cause of ocean-currents at
    great length in the various editions of his work, yet it is somewhat
    difficult to discover what they really are. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> arises chiefly
    from the generally confused and sometimes contradictory nature of
    his hydrodynamical conceptions. After a repeated perusal of several
    editions of his book, the following, I trust, will be found to be a
    pretty accurate representation of his theory:—</p>

  <p><em>Ocean-currents, according to Maury, due to Difference of Specific
    Gravity.</em>—Although Maury alludes to a number of causes which, he
    thinks, tend to produce currents, yet he deems their influence so
    small that, practically, all currents may be referred to difference of
    specific gravity.</p>

  <p>“If we except,” he says, “the tides, and the partial currents of the
    sea, such as those that may be created by the wind, we may lay it down
    as a rule that all the currents of the ocean owe their origin to the
    differences of specific gravity between sea-water at one place and
    sea-water at another; for wherever there is such a difference, whether
    it be owing to difference of temperature or to difference of saltness,
    &amp;c., it is a difference that disturbs equilibrium, and currents are the
    consequence” (§ 467)<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. To the same effect see §§ 896, 37, 512, 520,
    and 537.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that he is continually referring to difference
    of specific gravity as the great cause of currents, it is difficult to
    understand in what way he conceives this difference to act as a cause.</p>

  <p>Difference of specific gravity between the waters of the ocean at one
    place and another can give rise to currents only through the influence
    of the earth’s gravity. All currents resulting from difference of
    specific gravity can be ultimately resolved into the general principle
    that the molecules that are specifically heavier <em>descend</em> and displace
    those that are specifically lighter. If, for example, the ocean at the
    equator be expanded by heat or by any other cause, it will be forced by
    the denser waters in temperate and polar regions to rise so that its
    surface shall stand at a higher level than the surface of the ocean in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>these regions. The surface of the ocean will become an inclined plane,
    sloping from the equator to the poles. Hydro-statically, the ocean,
    considered as a mass, will then be in a state of equilibrium; but the
    individual molecules will not be in equilibrium. The molecules at the
    surface in this case may be regarded as lying on an inclined plane
    sloping from the equator down to the poles, and as these molecules
    are at liberty to move they will not remain at rest, but will descend
    the incline towards the poles. When the waters at the equator are
    expanded, or the waters at the poles contracted, gravitation makes, as
    it were, a twofold effort to restore equilibrium. It in the first place
    sinks the waters at the poles, and raises the waters at the equator,
    in order that the two masses may balance each other; but this very
    effort of gravitation to restore equilibrium to the mass destroys the
    equilibrium of the molecules by disturbing the level of the ocean. It
    then, in the second place, endeavours to restore equilibrium to the
    molecules by pulling the lighter surface water at the equator down the
    incline towards the poles. This tends not only to restore the level
    of the ocean, but to bring the lighter water to occupy the surface
    and the denser water the bottom of the ocean; and when this is done,
    complete equilibrium is restored, both to the mass of the ocean and
    to its individual molecules, and all further motion ceases. But if
    heat be constantly applied to the waters of the equatorial regions,
    and cold to those of the polar regions, and a permanent disturbance of
    equilibrium maintained, then the continual effort of gravitation to
    restore equilibrium will give rise to a constant current. In this case,
    the heat and the cold (the agents which disturb the equilibrium of the
    ocean) may be regarded as causes of the current, inasmuch as without
    them the current would not exist; but the real efficient cause, that
    which impels the water forward, is the force of gravity. But the force
    of gravity, as has already been noticed, cannot produce motion (perform
    work) unless the thing acted upon <em>descend</em>. Descent is implied in
    the very conception of a current produced by difference of specific
    gravity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

  <p>But Maury speaks as if difference of specific gravity could give rise
    to a current without any descent.</p>

  <p>“It is not necessary,” he says, “to associate with oceanic currents
    the idea that they must of necessity, as on land, run from a higher to
    a lower level. So far from this being the case, some currents of the
    sea actually run up hill, while others run on a level. The Gulf-stream
    is of the first class” (§ 403). “The top of the Gulf-stream runs on a
    level with the ocean; therefore we know it is not a descending current”
    (§ 18). And in § 9 he says that between the Straits of Florida and
    Cape Hatteras the waters of the Gulf-stream “are actually forced up an
    inclined plane, whose submarine ascent is not less than 10 inches to
    the mile.” To the same effect see §§ 25, 59.</p>

  <p>It is perfectly true that “it is not necessary to associate with
    ocean-currents the idea that they must of necessity, as on land,
    run from a higher to a lower level.” But the reason of this is that
    ocean-currents do not, like the currents on land, owe their motion to
    the force of gravitation. If ocean-currents result from difference of
    specific gravity between the waters in tropical and polar regions,
    as Maury maintains, then it is necessary to assume that they are
    descending currents. Whatever be the cause which may give rise to a
    difference of specific gravity, the motion which results from this
    difference is due wholly to the force of gravity; but gravity can
    produce no motion unless the water <em>descend</em>.</p>

  <p>This fact must be particularly borne in mind while we are considering
    Maury’s theory that currents are the result of difference of specific
    gravity.</p>

  <p>Ocean-currents, then, according to that writer, owe their existence to
    the difference of specific gravity between the waters of inter-tropical
    and polar regions. This difference of specific gravity he attributes to
    two causes—(1) to difference as to <em>temperature</em>, (2) to difference as
    to saltness. There are one or two causes of a minor nature affecting
    the specific gravity of the sea, to which he alludes; but these two
    determine the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> result. Let us begin with the consideration of
    the first of these two causes, viz.:—</p>

  <p><em>Difference of Specific Gravity resulting from Difference of
    Temperature.</em>—Maury explains his views on this point by means of an
    illustration. “Let us now suppose,” he says, “that all the water within
    the tropics, to the depth of one hundred fathoms, suddenly becomes oil.
    The aqueous equilibrium of the planet would thereby be disturbed, and
    a general system of currents and counter currents would be immediately
    commenced—the oil, in an unbroken sheet on the surface, running toward
    the poles, and the water, in an under current, toward the equator. The
    oil is supposed, as it reaches the polar basin, to be reconverted into
    water, and the water to become oil as it crosses Cancer and Capricorn,
    rising to the surface in inter-tropical regions, and returning as
    before” (§ 20). “Now,” he says (§ 22), “do not the cold waters of the
    north, and the warm waters of the Gulf, made specifically lighter by
    tropical heat, and which we see actually preserving such a system of
    counter currents, hold, at least in some degree, the relation of the
    supposed water and oil?”</p>

  <p>In § 24 he calculates that at the Narrows of Bemini the difference in
    weight between the volume of the Gulf-water that crosses a section of
    the stream in one second, and an equal volume of water at the ocean
    temperature of the latitude, supposing the two volumes to be equally
    salt, is fifteen millions of pounds. Consequently the force per second
    operating to propel the waters of the Gulf towards the pole would in
    this case, he concludes, be the “equilibrating tendency due to fifteen
    millions of pounds of water in the latitude of Bemini.” In §§ 511 and
    512 he states that the effect of expanding the waters at the torrid
    zone by heat, and of contracting the waters at the frigid zone by cold,
    is to produce a set of surface-currents of warm and light water from
    the equator towards the poles, and another set of under currents of
    cooler and heavy water from the poles towards the equator. (See also to
    the same effect §§ 513, 514, 896.)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that his conclusion is that the waters in
    inter-tropical regions are expanded by heat, while those in polar
    regions are contracted by cold, and that this tends to produce a
    surface current from the equator to the poles, and an under current
    from the poles to the equator.</p>

  <p>“We shall now consider his second great cause of ocean currents, viz.:—</p>

  <p><em>Difference of Specific Gravity resulting from Difference in Degree of
    Saltness.</em>—Maury maintains, and that correctly, that saltness increases
    the density of water—that, other things being equal, the saltest water
    is the densest. He suggests “that one of the purposes which, in the
    grand design, it was probably intended to accomplish by having the sea
    salt and not fresh, was to impart to its waters the forces and powers
    necessary to make their circulation complete” (§ 495).</p>

  <p>Now it is perfectly obvious that if difference in saltness is to
    co-operate with difference in temperature in the production of
    ocean-currents, the saltest waters, and consequently the densest, must
    be in the polar regions, and the waters least salt, and consequently
    lightest, must be in equatorial and inter-tropical regions. Were the
    saltest waters at the equator, and the freshest at the poles, it would
    tend to neutralize the effect due to heat, and, instead of producing
    a current, would simply tend to prevent the existence of the currents
    which otherwise would result from difference of temperature.</p>

  <p>A very considerable portion of his work, however, is devoted to proving
    that the waters of equatorial and inter-tropical regions are salter
    and heavier than those of the polar regions; and yet, notwithstanding
    this, he endeavours to show that this difference in respect to saltness
    between the waters of the equatorial and the polar regions is one of
    the chief causes, if not the chief cause, of ocean-currents. In fact,
    it is for this special end that so much labour is bestowed in proving
    that the saltest water is in the equatorial and inter-tropical regions,
    and the freshest in the polar.</p>

  <p>“In the present state of our knowledge,” he says, “concerning <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>this
    wonderful phenomenon (for the Gulf-stream is one of the most marvellous
    things in the ocean) we can do little more than conjecture. But we have
    two causes in operation which we may safely assume are among those
    concerned in producing the Gulf-stream. One of these is the increased
    saltness of its water after the trade-winds have been supplied with
    vapour from it, be it much or little; and the other is the diminished
    quantum of salt which the Baltic and the Northern Seas contain” (§ 37).
    “Now here we have, on one side, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico,
    with their waters of brine; on the other, the great Polar Basin, the
    Baltic, and the North Sea, the two latter with waters that are but
    little more than brackish. In one set of these sea-basins the water is
    heavy, in the other it is light. Between them the ocean intervenes; but
    water is bound to seek and to maintain its level; and here, therefore,
    we unmask one of the agents concerned in causing the Gulf-stream” (§
    38). To the same effect see §§ 52, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 528, 530,
    554, 556.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Maury’s <em>two causes neutralize each other</em>. Here we have two
    theories put forth regarding the cause of ocean-currents, the one
    in direct opposition to the other. According to the one theory,
    ocean-currents exist because the waters of equatorial regions, in
    consequence of their higher temperature, are <em>less dense</em> than the
    waters of the polar regions; but according to the other theory,
    ocean-currents exist because the waters of equatorial regions, in
    consequence of their greater saltness, are <em>more dense</em> than the
    waters of the polar regions. If the one cause be assigned as a reason
    why ocean-currents exist, then the other can be equally assigned as
    a reason why they should not exist. According to both theories it is
    the difference of density between the equatorial and polar waters that
    gives rise to currents; but while the one theory maintains that the
    equatorial waters are <em>lighter</em> than the polar, the other holds that
    they are <em>heavier</em>. Either the one theory or the other may be true,
    or neither; but it is logically impossible that both of them can. Let
    it be observed that it is not two currents, the one contrary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> to the
    other, with which we have at present to do; it is not temperature
    producing currents in one direction, and saltness producing currents
    in the contrary direction. We have two theories regarding the origin
    of currents, the one diametrically opposed to the other. The tendency
    of the one cause assigned is to prevent the action of the other. If
    temperature is allowed to act, it will make the inter-tropical waters
    lighter than the polar, and then, according to theory, a current will
    result. But if we bring saltness into play (the other cause) it will
    do the reverse: it will increase the density of the inter-tropical
    waters and diminish the density of the polar; and so far as it acts it
    will diminish the currents produced by temperature, because it will
    diminish the difference of specific gravity between the inter-tropical
    and polar regions which had been previously caused by temperature. And
    when the effects of saltness are as powerful as those of temperature,
    the difference of specific gravity produced by temperature will be
    completely effaced, or, in other words, the waters of the equatorial
    and polar seas will be of the same density, and consequently no current
    will exist. And so long as the two causes continue in action, no
    current can arise, unless the energy of the one cause should happen to
    exceed that of the other; and even then a current will only exist to
    the extent by which the strength of the one exceeds that of the other.</p>

  <p>The contrary nature of the two theories will be better seen by
    considering the way in which it is supposed that difference in saltness
    is produced and acts as a cause.</p>

  <p>If there is a constant current resulting from the difference in
    saltness between the equatorial and polar waters, then there must be a
    cause which maintains this difference. The current is simply the effort
    to restore the equilibrium lost by the difference; and the current
    would very soon do this, and then all motion would cease, were there
    not a constantly operating cause maintaining the disturbance. What,
    then, according to Maury, is the cause of this disturbance, or, in
    other words, what is it that keeps the equatorial waters salter than
    the polar?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

  <p>The agencies in operation are stated by him to be heat, radiation,
    evaporation, precipitation, and secretion of solid matter in the form
    of shells, &amp;c. The two most important, however, are evaporation and
    precipitation.</p>

  <p>The trade-winds enter the equatorial regions as relatively dry winds
    thirsting for vapour; consequently they absorb far more moisture than
    they give out; and the result is that in inter-tropical regions,
    evaporation is much in excess of precipitation; and as fresh water only
    is taken up, the salt being left behind, the process, of course, tends
    to increase the saltness of the inter-tropical seas. Again, in polar
    and extra-tropical regions the reverse is the case; precipitation is in
    excess of evaporation. This tends in turn to diminish the saltness of
    the waters of those regions. (See on these points §§ 31, 33, 34, 37,
    179, 517, 526, and 552.)</p>

  <p>In the system of circulation produced by difference of temperature,
    as we have already seen, the surface-currents flow from the equator
    to the poles, and the under or return currents from the poles to the
    equator; but in the system produced by difference of saltness, the
    surface currents flow from the poles to the equator, and the return
    under currents from the equator to the poles. That the surface currents
    produced by difference of saltness flow from the poles to the equator,
    Maury thinks is evident for the two following reasons:—</p>

  <p>(1) As evaporation is in excess of precipitation in inter-tropical
    regions, more water is taken off the surface of the ocean in those
    regions than falls upon it in the form of rain. This excess of water
    falls in the form of rain on temperate and polar regions, where,
    consequently, precipitation is in excess of evaporation. The lifting
    of the water off the equatorial regions and its deposit on the polar
    tend to lower the level of the ocean in equatorial regions and to raise
    the level in polar; consequently, in order to restore the level of
    the ocean, the surface water at the polar regions flows towards the
    equatorial regions.</p>

  <p>(2) As the water taken up at the equator is fresh, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> salt
    is left behind, the ocean, in inter-tropical regions, is thus made
    saltier and consequently denser. This dense water, therefore, sinks
    and passes away as an under current. This water, evaporated from
    inter-tropical regions, falls as fresh and lighter water in temperate
    and polar regions; and therefore not only is the level of the ocean
    raised, but the waters are made lighter. Hence, in order to restore
    equilibrium, the waters in temperate and polar regions will flow as
    a surface current towards the equator. Under currents will flow from
    the equator to the poles, and surface or upper currents from the poles
    to the equator. Difference in temperature and difference in saltness,
    therefore, in every respect tend to produce opposite effects.</p>

  <p>That the above is a fair representation of the way in which Maury
    supposes difference in saltness to act as a cause in the production of
    ocean-currents will appear from the following quotations:—</p>

  <p>“In those regions, as in the trade-wind region, where evaporation is
    in excess of precipitation, the general level of this supposed sea
    would be altered, and immediately as much water as is carried off by
    evaporation would commence to flow in from north and south toward the
    trade-wind or evaporation region, to restore the level” (§ 509). “On
    the other hand, the winds have taken this vapour, borne it off to the
    extra-tropical regions, and precipitated it, we will suppose, where
    precipitation is in excess of evaporation. Here is another alteration
    of sea-level, by elevation instead of by depression; and hence we
    have the motive power for a <em>surface current from each pole towards
    the equator</em>, the object of which is only to supply the demand for
    evaporation in the trade-wind regions” (§ 510).</p>

  <p>The above result would follow, supposing the ocean to be fresh. He then
    proceeds to consider an additional result that follows in consequence
    of the saltness of the ocean.</p>

  <p>“Let evaporation now commence in the trade-wind region, as it was
    supposed to do in the case of the freshwater seas, and as it actually
    goes on in nature—and what takes place? Why a lowering of the sea-level
    as before. But as the vapour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> of salt water is fresh, or nearly so,
    fresh water only is taken up from the ocean; that which remains behind
    is therefore more salt. Thus, while the level is lowered in the salt
    sea, the equilibrium is destroyed because of the saltness of the water;
    for the water that remains after evaporation takes place is, on account
    of the solid matter held in solution, specifically heavier than it was
    before any portion of it was converted into vapour” (§ 517).</p>

  <p>“The vapour is taken from the surface-water; the surface-water thereby
    becomes more salt, and, under certain conditions, heavier. When it
    becomes heavier, it sinks; and hence we have, due to the salts of the
    sea, a vertical circulation, namely, a descent of heavier—because
    salter and cooler—water from the surface, and an ascent of water that
    is lighter—because it is not so salt—from the depths below” (§ 518).</p>

  <p>In section 519 he goes on to show that this vapour removed from the
    inter-tropical region is precipitated in the polar regions, where
    precipitation is in excess of evaporation. “In the precipitating
    regions, therefore, the level is destroyed, as before explained, by
    elevation, and in the evaporating regions by depression; which, as
    already stated, gives rise to a system of <em>surface</em> currents, moved by
    gravity alone, from the <em>poles towards the equator</em>” (§ 520).</p>

  <p>“This fresh water being emptied into the Polar Sea and agitated by the
    winds, becomes mixed with the salt; but as the agitation of the sea by
    the winds is supposed to extend to no great depth, it is only the upper
    layer of salt water, and that to a moderate depth, which becomes mixed
    with the fresh. The specific gravity of this upper layer, therefore, is
    diminished just as much as the specific gravity of the sea-water in the
    evaporating regions was increased. <em>And thus we have a surface current
    of saltish water from the poles towards the equator, and an under
    current of water salter and heavier from the equator to the poles</em>” (§
    522).</p>

  <p>“This property of saltness imparts to the waters of the ocean another
    peculiarity, by which the sea is still better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> adapted for the
    regulation of climates, and it is this: by evaporating fresh water from
    the salt in the tropics, the surface water becomes heavier than the
    average of sea-water. This heavy water is also warm water; it sinks,
    and being a good retainer, but a bad conductor, of heat, this water
    is employed in transporting through <em>under currents</em> heat for the
    mitigation of climates in far distant regions” (§ 526).</p>

  <p>“For instance, let us suppose the waters in a certain part of the
    torrid zone to be 90°, but by reason of the fresh water which has been
    taken from them in a state of vapour, and consequently, by reason of
    the proportionate increase of salts, these waters are heavier than
    waters that may be cooler, but not so salt. This being the case, the
    tendency would be for this warm but salt and heavy water to flow off as
    an <em>under current towards the polar or some other regions of lighter
    water</em>” (§ 554).</p>

  <p>That Maury supposes the warm water at the equator to flow to the polar
    regions as an under current is further evident from the fact that he
    maintains that the climate of the arctic regions is mitigated by a warm
    under current, which comes from the equatorial regions, and passes up
    through Davis Straits (see §§ 534−544).</p>

  <p>The question now suggests itself: to which of these two antagonistic
    causes does Maury really suppose ocean-currents must be referred?
    Whether does he suppose, difference in temperature or difference in
    saltness, to be the real cause? I have been unable to find anything
    from which we can reasonably conclude that he prefers the one cause
    to the other. It would seem that he regards both as real causes, and
    that he has failed to perceive that the one is destructive of the
    other. But it is difficult to conceive how he could believe that the
    sea in equatorial regions, by virtue of its higher temperature, is
    lighter than the sea in polar regions, while at the same time it <em>is
    not</em> lighter but heavier, in consequence of its greater saltness—how
    he could believe that the warm water at the equator flows to the poles
    as an upper current, and the cold water at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> the poles to the equator
    as an <em>under</em> current, while at the same time the warm water at the
    equator does not flow to the poles as a surface current, nor the cold
    water at the poles to the equator as an under current, but the reverse.
    And yet, unless these absolute impossibilities be possible, how can an
    ocean-current be the result of both causes?</p>

  <p>The only explanation of the matter appears to be that Maury has failed
    to perceive the contradictory nature of his two theories. This fact is
    particularly seen when he comes to apply his two theories to the case
    of the Gulf-stream. He maintains, as has already been stated, that
    the waters of the Gulf-stream are salter than the waters of the sea
    through which they flow (see §§ 3, 28, 29, 30, 34, and several other
    places). And he states, as we have already seen (see p. 104), that the
    existence of the Gulf-stream is due principally to the difference of
    density of the water of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico as
    compared with that of the great Polar Basin and the North Sea. There
    can be no doubt whatever that it is the <em>density</em> of the waters of the
    Gulf-stream at its fountain-head, the Gulf of Mexico, resulting from
    its superior saltness, and the deficiency of density of the waters in
    polar regions and the North Sea, &amp;c., that is here considered to be
    unmasked as one of the agents. If this be a cause of the motion of the
    Gulf-stream, how then can the difference of temperature between the
    waters of inter-tropical and polar regions assist as a cause? This
    difference of temperature will simply tend to undo all that has been
    done by difference of saltness: for it will tend to make the waters
    of the Gulf of Mexico lighter, and the waters of the polar regions
    heavier. But Maury maintains, as we have seen, that this difference of
    temperature is also a cause, which shows that he does not perceive the
    contradiction.</p>

  <p>This is still further apparent. He holds, as stated, that “the waters
    of the Gulf-stream are salter than the waters of the sea through which
    they flow,” and that this excess in saltness, by making the water
    heavier, is a cause of the motion of the stream. But he maintains that,
    notwithstanding the effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> which greater saltness has in increasing
    the density of the waters of the Gulf-stream, yet, owing to their
    higher temperature, they are actually lighter than the water through
    which they flow; and as a proof that this is the case, he adduces the
    fact that the surface of the Gulf-stream is roof-shaped (§§ 39−41),
    which it could not be were its waters not actually lighter than the
    waters through which the stream flows. So it turns out that, in
    contradiction to what he had already stated, it is the lesser density
    of the waters of the Gulf-stream that is the real cause of their
    motion. The greater saltness of the waters, to which he attributes so
    much, can in no way be regarded as a cause of motion. Its effect, so
    far as it goes, is to stop the motion of the stream rather than to
    assist it.</p>

  <p>But, again, although he asserts that difference of saltness and
    difference of temperature are both causes of ocean-currents, yet he
    appears actually to admit that temperature and saltness neutralize each
    other so as to prevent change in the specific gravity of the ocean, as
    will be seen from the following quotation:—</p>

  <p>“It is the trade-winds, then, which prevent the thermal and
    specific gravity curves from conforming with each other in
    inter-tropical seas. The water they suck up is fresh water; and
    the salt it contained, being left behind, is just sufficient to
    counterbalance, by its weight, the effect of thermal dilatation upon
    the specific gravity of sea-water between the parallels of 34° north
    and south. As we go from 34° to the equator, the water grows warmer and
    expands. It would become lighter; but the trade-winds, by taking up
    vapour without salt, make the water salter, and therefore heavier. The
    conclusion is, the proportion of salt in sea-water, its expansibility
    between 62° and 82°, and the thirst of the trade-winds for vapour are,
    where they blow, so balanced as to produce <em>perfect compensation</em>; and
    a more beautiful compensation cannot, it appears to me, be found in the
    mechanism of the universe than that which we have here stumbled upon.
    It is a triple adjustment; the power of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> sun to expand, the power
    of the winds to evaporate, and the quantity of salts in the sea—these
    are so proportioned and adjusted that when both the wind and the sun
    have each played with its forces upon the inter-tropical waters of the
    ocean, <em>the residuum of heat and of salt should be just such as to
    balance each other in their effects; and so the aqueous equilibrium of
    the torrid zone is preserved</em>” (§ 436, eleventh edition).</p>

  <p>“Between 35° or 40° and the equator evaporation is in excess of
    precipitation; and though, as we approach the equator on either side
    from these parallels, the solar ray warms and expands the surface-water
    of the sea, the winds, by the vapour they carry off, and the salt they
    leave behind, <em>prevent it from making that water lighter</em>” (§ 437,
    eleventh edition).</p>

  <p>“Philosophers have admired the relations between the size of the earth,
    the force of gravity, and the strength of fibre in the flower-stalks of
    plants; but how much more exquisite is the system of counterpoises and
    adjustments here presented between the sea and its salts, the winds and
    the heat of the sun!” (§ 438, eleventh edition).</p>

  <p>How can this be reconciled with all that precedes regarding
    ocean-currents being the result of difference of specific gravity
    caused by a difference of temperature and difference of saltness? Here
    is a distinct recognition of the fact that difference in saltness,
    instead of producing currents, tends rather to prevent the existence of
    currents, by counteracting the effects of difference in temperature.
    And so effectually does it do this, that for 40°, or nearly 3,000
    miles, on each side of the equator there is absolutely no difference in
    the specific gravity of the ocean, and consequently nothing, either as
    regards difference of temperature or difference of saltness, that can
    possibly give rise to a current.</p>

  <p>But it is evident that, if between the equator and latitude 40° the
    two effects completely neutralize each other, it is not at all likely
    that between latitude 40° and the poles they will not to a large extent
    do the same thing. And if so, how can ocean-currents be due either
    to difference in temperature or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> difference in saltness, far less
    to both. If there be any difference of specific gravity of the ocean
    between latitude 40° and the poles, it must be only to the extent
    by which the one cause has failed to neutralize the other. If, for
    example, the waters in latitude 40°, by virtue of higher temperature,
    are less dense than the waters in the polar regions, they can be so
    only to the extent that difference in saltness has failed to neutralize
    the effect of difference in temperature. And if currents result, they
    can do so only to the extent that difference in saltness has thus
    fallen short of being able to produce complete compensation. Maury,
    after stating his views on compensation, seems to become aware of
    this; but, strangely, he does not appear to perceive, or, at least, he
    does not make any allusion to the fact, that all this is fatal to his
    theories about ocean-currents being the combined result of differences
    of temperature and of saltness. For, in opposition to all that he
    had previously advanced regarding the difficulty of finding a cause
    sufficiently powerful to account for such currents as the Gulf-stream,
    and the great importance that difference in saltness had in their
    production, he now begins to maintain that so great is the influence
    of difference in temperature that difference in saltness, and a number
    of other compensating causes are actually necessary to prevent the
    ocean-currents from becoming too powerful.</p>

  <p>“If all the inter-tropical heat of the sun,” he says, “were to pass
    into the seas upon which it falls, simply raising the temperature of
    their waters, it would create a thermo-dynamical force in the ocean
    capable of transporting water scalding hot from the torrid zone, and
    spreading it while still in the tepid state around the poles.... Now,
    suppose there were no trade-winds to evaporate and to counteract the
    dynamical force of the sun, this hot and light water, by becoming
    hotter and lighter, would flow off in currents with almost mill-tail
    velocity towards the poles, covering the intervening sea with a mantle
    of warmth as a garment. The cool and heavy water of the polar basin,
    coming out as under currents, would flow equatorially with equal
    velocity.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <p>“Thus two antagonistic forces are unmasked, and, being unmasked, we
    discover in them a most exquisite adjustment—a compensation—by which
    the dynamical forces that reside in the sunbeam and the trade-wind
    are made to counterbalance each other, by which the climates of
    inter-tropical seas are regulated, and by which the set, force, and
    volume of oceanic currents are measured” (§§ 437 and 438, eleventh
    edition).</p>

  <p><em>How the Question may be Determined.</em>—Whether the circulation of the
    ocean is due to difference in specific gravity or not may be determined
    in three ways: viz. (1) by direct experiment; (2) by ascertaining the
    absolute amount of <em>force</em> acting on the water to produce motion, in
    virtue of difference of specific gravity, and thereafter comparing it
    with the force which has been shown by experiment to be necessary to
    the production of sensible motion; or (3) by determining the greatest
    possible amount of <em>work</em> which gravity can perform on the waters in
    virtue of difference of specific gravity, and then ascertaining if the
    work of gravity does or does not equal the work of the resistances in
    the required motion. But Maury has not adopted either of these methods.</p>

  <p><em>The Force resulting from Difference of Specific Gravity.</em>—I shall
    consider first whether the force resulting from difference of specific
    gravity be sufficient to account for the motion of ocean-currents.</p>

  <p>The inadequacy of this cause has been so clearly shown by Sir John
    Herschel, that one might expect that little else would be required than
    simply to quote his words on the subject, which are as follows:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

  <p>“First, then, if there were no atmosphere, there would be no
    Gulf-stream, or any other considerable ocean-current (as distinguished
    from a mere surface-drift) whatever. By the action of the sun’s rays,
    the <em>surface</em> of the ocean becomes <em>most</em> heated, and the heated water
    will, therefore, neither directly tend to <em>ascend</em> (which it could
    not do without leaving the sea) nor to <em>descend</em>, which it cannot do,
    being rendered buoyant, nor to move laterally, no lateral impulse being
    given, and which it could only do by reason of a general declivity
    of surface, the dilated portion occupying a higher level. Let us see
    what this declivity would amount to. The equatorial surface-water
    has a temperature of 84°. At 7,200 feet deep the temperature is 39°,
    the level of which temperature rises to the surface in latitude 56°.
    Taking the dilatability of sea-water to be the same as that of fresh, a
    uniformly progressive increase of temperature, from 39° to 84° Fahr.,
    would dilate a column of 7,200 feet by 10 feet, to which height,
    therefore, above the spheroid of equilibrium (or above the sea-level in
    lat. 56°), the equatorial surface is actually raised by dilatation. An
    arc of 56° on the earth’s surface measures 3,360 geographical miles;
    so that we have a slope of 1/28th of an inch per geographical mile, or
    1/32nd of an inch per statute mile for the water so raised to run down.
    As the accelerating force corresponding to such a slope (of 1/10th of
    a second, 0″·1) is less than one two-millionth part of gravity, we
    may dismiss this as a cause capable of creating only a very trifling
    surface-drift, and not worth considering, even were it in the proper
    direction to form, by concentration, a current from east to west,
    <em>which it could not be, but the very reverse</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

  <p>It is singular how any one, even though he regarded this conclusion as
    but a rough approximation to the truth, could entertain the idea that
    ocean-currents can be the result of difference in specific gravity.
    There are one or two reasons, however, which may be given for the
    above not having been generally received as conclusive. Herschel’s
    calculations refer to the difference of gravity resulting from
    difference of temperature; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>but this is only one of the causes to which
    Maury appeals, and even not the one to which he most frequently refers.
    He insists so strongly on the effects of difference of saltness, that
    many might think that, although Herschel may have shown that difference
    in specific gravity arising from difference of temperature could not
    account for the motion of ocean-currents, yet nevertheless that this,
    combined with the effects resulting from difference in saltness, might
    be a sufficient explanation of the phenomena. Such, of course, would
    not be the case with those who perceived the contradictory nature of
    Maury’s two causes; but probably many read the “Physical Geography of
    the Sea” without being aware that the one cause is destructive of the
    other. Again, a few plausible objections, which have never received due
    consideration, have been strongly urged by Maury and others against the
    theory that ocean-currents can be caused by the impulses of the winds;
    and probably these objections appear to militate as strongly against
    this theory as Herschel’s arguments against Maury’s.</p>

  <p>There is one trifling objection to Herschel’s result: he takes 39° as
    the temperature of maximum density. This, however, as we shall see,
    does not materially affect his conclusions.</p>

  <p>Observations on the temperature of the maximum density of sea-water
    have been made by Erman, Despretz, Rossetti, Neumann, Marcet, Hubbard,
    Horner, and others. No two of them have arrived at exactly the same
    conclusion. This probably arises from the fact that the temperature
    of maximum density depends upon the amount of salt held in solution.
    No two seas, unless they are equal as to saltness, have the same
    temperature of maximum density. The following Table of Despretz will
    show how rapidly the temperature of both the freezing-point and of
    maximum density is lowered by additional amounts of salt:—</p>

  <p>He found the temperature of maximum density of sea-water, whose density
    at 20°C. was 1·0273, to be −3°·67C. (25°·4F.), and the temperature of
    freezing-point −2°·55C. (27°·4F.).<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Somewhere between 25° and 26°
    F. may therefore be regarded as the temperature of maximum density
    of sea-water of average saltness. We have no reason to believe that
    the ocean, from the surface to the bottom, even at the poles, is at
    27°·4F., the freezing-point.</p>

  <p>The actual slope resulting from difference of specific gravity,
    as we shall presently see, does not amount to 10 feet. Herschel’s
    estimate was, however, made on insufficient data, both as to the rate
    of expansion of sea-water and that at which the temperature of the
    ocean at the equator decreases from the surface downwards. We are
    happily now in the possession of data for determining with tolerable
    accuracy the amount of slope due to difference of temperature between
    the equatorial and polar seas. The rate of expansion of sea-water
    from 0°C. to 100°C. has been experimentally determined by Professor
    Muncke, of Heidelberg.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The valuable reports of Captain Nares, of
    H.M.S. <cite>Challenger</cite>, lately published by the Admiralty, give the rate
    at which the temperature of the Atlantic at the equator decreases
    from the surface downwards. These observations show clearly that the
    super-heating effect of the sun’s rays does not extend to any great
    depth. They also prove that at the equator the temperature decreases
    as the depth increases so rapidly that at 60 fathoms from the surface
    the temperature is 62°·4, the same as at Madeira at the same depth;
    while at the depth of 150 fathoms it is only 51°, about the same as
    that in the Bay of Biscay (Reports, p. 11). Here at the very outset
    we have broad and important facts hostile to the theory of a flow of
    water resulting from difference of temperature between the ocean in
    equatorial and temperate and polar regions.</p>

  <p>Through the kindness of Staff-Captain Evans, Hydrographer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>of the
    Admiralty, I have been favoured with a most valuable set of serial
    temperature soundings made by Captain Nares of the <cite>Challenger</cite>, close
    to the equator, between long. 14° 49′ W. and 32° 16′ W. The following

  <p>We have in this Table data for determining the height at which the
    surface of the ocean at the equator ought to stand above that of the
    poles. Assuming 32°F. to be the temperature of the ocean at the poles
    from the surface to the bottom and the foregoing to be the rate at
    which the temperature of the ocean at the equator decreases from the
    surface downwards, and then calculating according to Muncke’s Table of
    the expansion of sea-water, we have only 4 feet 6 inches as the height
    to which the level of the ocean at the equator ought to stand above
    that at the poles in order that the ocean may be in static equilibrium.
    In other words, the equatorial column requires to be only 4 feet 6
    inches higher than the polar in order that the two may balance each
    other.</p>

  <p>Taking the distance from the equator to the poles at 6,200 miles, the
    force resulting from the slope of 4½ feet in 6,200 will amount to only
    1/7,340,000th that of gravity, or about 1/1000th of a grain on a pound
    of water. But, as we shall shortly see, there can be no permanent
    current resulting from difference of temperature while the two columns
    remain in equilibrium, for the current is simply an effort to the
    retardation of equilibrium. In order to have permanent circulation
    there must be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> permanent disturbance of equilibrium. Or, in other
    words, the weight of the polar column must be kept in excess of that
    of the equatorial. Suppose, then, that the weight of the polar column
    exceeds that of the equatorial by 2 feet of water, the difference of
    level between the two columns will, in that case, amount to only 2
    feet 6 inches. This would give a force of only 1/13,200,000th that of
    gravity, or not much over 1/1,900th of a grain on a pound of water,
    tending to draw the water down the slope from the equator to the poles,
    a force which does not much exceed the weight of a grain on a ton of
    water. But it must be observed that this force of a grain per ton would
    affect only the water at the surface; a very short distance below the
    surface the force, small as it is, would be enormously reduced. If
    water were a perfect fluid, and offered no resistance to motion, it
    would not only flow down an incline, however small it might be, but
    would flow down with an accelerated motion. But water is not a perfect
    fluid, and its molecules do offer considerable resistance to motion.
    Water flowing down an incline, however steep it may be, soon acquires
    a uniform motion. There must therefore be a certain inclination below
    which no motion can take place. Experiments were made by M. Dubuat
    with the view of determining this limit.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> He found that when the
    inclination was 1 in 500,000, the motion of the water was barely
    perceptible; and he came to the conclusion that when the inclination
    is reduced to 1 in 1,000,000, all motion ceases. But the inclination
    afforded by the difference of temperature between the sea in equatorial
    and polar regions does not amount to one-seventh of this, and
    consequently it can hardly produce even that “trifling surface-drift”
    which Sir John Herschel is willing to attribute to it.</p>

  <p>There is an error into which some writers appear to fall to which I
    may here refer. Suppose that at the equator we have to descend 10,000
    feet before water equal in density to that at the poles is reached. We
    have in this case a plain with a slope <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>of 10,000 feet in 6,200 miles,
    forming the upper surface of the water of maximum density. Now this
    slope exercises no influence in the way of producing a current, as some
    seem to think; for it is not a case of disturbed equilibrium, but the
    reverse. It is the condition of static equilibrium resulting from a
    difference between the temperature of the water at the equator and the
    poles. The only slope that has any tendency to produce motion is that
    which is formed by the surface of the ocean in the equatorial regions
    being higher than the surface at the poles; but this is an inclination
    of only 4 feet 6 inches, and is therefore wholly inadequate to produce
    such currents as the Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>In attempting to estimate the adequacy of this hypothesis as an
    explanation of the phenomena involved, there are obviously two
    questions to be considered: namely, (1) is the difference of
    temperature between the sea in inter-tropical and polar regions
    sufficiently great to produce the required movement? and (2) assuming
    that there is such a movement, does it convey the amount of heat which
    Dr. Carpenter supposes? I shall begin with the consideration of the
    first of these two points.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

  <p>But before doing so let us see what the facts are which this
    gravitation theory is intended to explain.</p>

  <p><em>The Facts to be Explained.</em>—Dr. Carpenter considers that the great
    mass of warm water proved during recent dredging expeditions to
    occupy the depths of the North Atlantic, must be referred, not to the
    Gulf-stream, but to a general movement of water from the equator. “The
    inference seems inevitable,” he says, “that the bulk of the water in
    the warm area must have come thither from the south-west. The influence
    of the Gulf-stream proper (meaning by this the body of super-heated
    water which issues through the ‘Narrows’ from the Gulf of Mexico), if
    it reaches this locality at all (which is very doubtful), could only
    affect the <em>most superficial</em> stratum; and the same may be said of
    the surface-drift caused by the prevalence of south-westerly winds,
    to which some have attributed the phenomena usually accounted for by
    the extension of the Gulf-stream to these regions. And the presence
    of the body of water which lies between 100 and 600 fathoms deep, and
    the range of whose temperature is from 48° to 42°, can scarcely be
    accounted for on any other hypothesis than that of a <em>great general
    movement of equatorial water towards the polar area</em>, of which
    movement the Gulf-stream constitutes a peculiar case modified by local
    conditions. In like manner the Arctic stream which underlies the warm
    superficial stratum in our cold area constitutes a peculiar case,
    modified by the local conditions to be presently explained, of <em>a great
    general movement of polar water towards the equatorial area</em>, which
    depresses the temperature of the deepest parts of the great oceanic
    basins nearly to the freezing-point.”</p>

  <p>It is well-known that, wherever temperature-observations have been
    made in the Atlantic, the bottom of that ocean has been found to be
    occupied by water of an ice-cold temperature. And this holds true
    not merely of the Atlantic, but also of the ocean in inter-tropical
    regions—a fact which has been proved by repeated observations, and more
    particularly of late by those of Commander Chimmo in the China Sea and
    Indian Ocean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> where a temperature as low as 32° Fahr. was found at a
    depth of 2,656 fathoms. In short, the North Atlantic, and probably the
    inter-tropical seas also, may be regarded, Dr. Carpenter considers, as
    divided horizontally into two great layers or strata—an upper warm, and
    a lower cold stratum. All these facts I, of course, freely admit; nor
    am I aware that their truth has been called in question by any one, no
    matter what his views may have been as to the mode in which they are to
    be explained.</p>

  <p><em>The Explanation of the Facts.</em>—We have next the explanation of the
    facts, which is simply this:—The cold water occupying the bottom of
    the Atlantic and of inter-tropical seas is to be accounted for by the
    supposition that <em>it came from the polar regions</em>. This is obvious,
    because the cold possessed by the water could not have been derived
    from the crust of the earth beneath: neither could it have come from
    the surface; for the temperature of the bottom water is far below the
    normal temperature of the latitude in which it is found. Consequently
    “the inference seems irresistible that this depression must be produced
    and maintained by the convection of cold from the polar towards the
    equatorial area.” Of course, if we suppose a flow of water from the
    poles towards the equator, we must necessarily infer a counter flow
    from the equator towards the poles; and while the water flowing from
    equatorial to polar regions will be <em>warm</em>, that flowing from polar to
    equatorial regions will be <em>cold</em>. The doctrine of a mutual interchange
    of equatorial and polar water is therefore a <em>necessary consequence</em>
    from the admission of the foregoing facts. With this <em>explanation
    of the facts</em> I need hardly say that I fully agree; nor am I aware
    that its correctness has ever been disputed. Dr. Carpenter surely
    cannot charge me with overlooking the fact of a mutual interchange of
    equatorial and polar water, seeing that my estimate of the thermal
    power of the Gulf-stream, from which it is proved that the amount
    of heat conveyed from equatorial to temperate and polar regions
    is enormously greater than had ever been anticipated, was made a
    considerable time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> before he began to write on the subject of oceanic
    circulation.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> And in my paper “On Ocean-currents in relation to the
    Distribution of Heat over the Globe”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> (the substance of which is
    reproduced in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_II">II.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III.</a> of this volume), I have endeavoured
    to show that, were it not for the raising of the temperature of polar
    and high temperate regions and the lowering of the temperature of
    inter-tropical regions by means of this interchange of water, these
    portions of the globe would not be habitable by the present existing
    orders of beings.</p>

  <p>The explanation goes further:—“It is along the surface and upper
    portion of the ocean that the equatorial waters flow towards the
    poles, and it is along the bottom and under portion of the ocean that
    polar waters flow towards the equator; or, in other words, the warm
    water keeps the <em>upper</em> portion of the ocean and the cold water the
    <em>under</em> portion.” With this explanation I to a great extent agree. It
    is evident that, in reference to the northern hemisphere at least, the
    most of the water which flows from inter-tropical to polar regions
    (as, for example, the Gulf-stream) keeps to the surface and upper
    portion of the ocean; but for reasons which I have already stated, a
    very large proportion of this water must return in the form of <em>under</em>
    currents; or, which is the same thing, the return compensating current,
    whether it consist of the identical water which originally came from
    the equator or not, must flow towards the equator as an under current.
    That the cold water which is found at the bottom of the Atlantic and
    of inter-tropical seas must have come as under currents is perfectly
    obvious, because water which should come along the surface of the ocean
    from the polar regions would not be cold when it reached inter-tropical
    regions.</p>

  <p><em>The Explanation hypothetical.</em>—Here the general agreement between
    us in a great measure terminates, for Dr. Carpenter is not satisfied
    with the explanation generally adopted by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>advocates of the
    <em>wind theory</em>, viz., that the cold water found in temperate and
    inter-tropical areas comes from polar regions as compensating under
    currents, but advances a <em>hypothetical</em> form of circulation to account
    for the phenomenon. He assumes that there is a <em>general set</em> or flow of
    the surface and upper portion of the ocean from the equator to polar
    regions, and a <em>general set</em> or flow of the bottom and under portion of
    the ocean from polar regions to the equator. Mr. Ferrel (<cite>Nature</cite>, June
    13, 1872) speaks of that “interchanging motion of the water between the
    equator and the pole <em>discovered</em> by Dr. Carpenter.” In this, however,
    Mr. Ferrel is mistaken; for Dr. Carpenter not only makes no claim to
    any discovery of the kind, but distinctly admits that none such has
    yet been made. Although in some of his papers he speaks of a “<em>set</em> of
    warm surface-water in the southern oceans toward the Antarctic pole”
    as being well known to navigators, yet he nowhere affirms, as far as I
    know, that the existence of such a general oceanic circulation as he
    advocates has ever been directly determined from observations. This
    mode of circulation is <em>simply inferred</em> or <em>assumed</em> in order to
    account for the facts referred to above. “At present,” Dr. Carpenter
    says, “I claim for it no higher character than that of a good working
    <em>hypothesis</em> to be used as a guide in further inquiry” (§ 16); and lest
    there should be any misapprehension on this point, he closes his memoir
    thus:—“At present, as I have already said, I claim for the doctrine of
    a general oceanic circulation no higher a character than that of a good
    working <em>hypothesis</em> consistent with our present knowledge of facts,
    and therefore entitled to be <em>provisionally</em> adopted for the purpose of
    stimulating and directing further inquiry.”</p>

  <p>I am unable to agree with him, however, on this latter point. It
    seems to me that there is no necessity for adopting any hypothetical
    mode of circulation to account for the facts, as they can be quite
    well accounted for by means of that mode of circulation which does
    <em>actually exist</em>. It has been determined from direct observation that
    surface-currents flow from equatorial to polar regions, and their
    paths have been actually mapped out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> But if it is established that
    currents flow from equatorial to polar regions, it is equally so that
    return currents flow from polar to equatorial regions; for if the one
    <em>actually</em> exists, the other of necessity <em>must</em> exist. We know also
    on physical grounds, to which I have already referred, and which fall
    to be considered more fully in a subsequent chapter, that a very large
    portion of the water flowing from polar to equatorial regions must
    be in the form of under currents. If there are cold under currents,
    therefore, flowing from polar to temperate and equatorial regions,
    this is all that we really require to account for the cold water which
    is found to occupy the bed of the ocean in those regions. It does not
    necessarily follow, because cold water may be found at the bottom of
    the ocean all along the equator, that there must be a direct flow
    from the polar regions to every point of the equator. Water brought
    constantly from the polar regions to various points along the equator
    by means of under currents will necessarily accumulate, and in course
    of time spread over the bottom of the inter-tropical seas. It must
    either do this, or the currents on reaching the equator must bend
    upwards and flow to the surface in an unbroken mass. Considerable
    portions of some of those currents may no doubt do so and join
    surface-currents; but probably the greater portion of the water coming
    from polar regions extends itself over the floor of the equatorial
    seas. In a letter in <cite>Nature</cite>, January 11, 1872, I endeavoured to show
    that the surface-currents of the ocean are not separate and independent
    of one another, but form one grand system of circulation, and that
    the impelling cause keeping up this system of circulation is not the
    <em>trade-winds</em> alone, as is generally supposed, but the <em>prevailing
    winds of the entire globe considered also as one grand system</em>. The
    evidence for this opinion, however, will be considered more fully in
    the sequel.</p>

  <p>Although the under currents are parts of one general system of oceanic
    circulation produced by the impulse of the system of prevailing winds,
    yet their direction and position are nevertheless, to a large extent,
    determined by different laws. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> water at the surface, being moved
    by the force of the wind, will follow the path of <em>greatest pressure
    and traction</em>,—the effects resulting from the general contour of the
    land, which to a great extent are common to both sets of currents, not
    being taken into account; while, on the other hand, the under currents
    from polar regions (which to a great extent are simply “indraughts”
    compensating for the water drained from equatorial regions by the
    Gulf-stream and other surface currents) will follow, as a general rule,
    the path of <em>least resistance</em>.</p>

  <p><em>The Cause assigned for the Hypothetical Mode of Circulation.</em>—Dr.
    Carpenter assigns a cause for his mode of circulation; and that cause
    he finds in the difference of specific gravity between equatorial
    and polar waters, resulting from the difference of temperature
    between these two regions. “Two separate questions,” he says, “have
    to be considered, which have not, perhaps, been kept sufficiently
    distinct, either by Mr. Croll or by myself;—<em>first</em>, whether there
    is adequate evidence of the existence of a general vertical oceanic
    circulation; and <em>second</em>, whether, supposing its existence to be
    provisionally admitted, a <i lang="la">vera causa</i> can be found for it in the
    difference of temperature between the oceanic waters of the polar and
    equatorial areas” (§ 17). It seems to me that the facts adduced by
    Dr. Carpenter do not necessarily require the assumption of any such
    mode of circulation as that advanced by him. The phenomena can be
    satisfactorily accounted for otherwise; and therefore there does not
    appear to be any necessity for considering whether his hypothesis be
    sufficient to produce the required effect or not.</p>

  <p><em>An important Consideration overlooked.</em>—But there is one important
    consideration which seems to have been overlooked—namely, the fact
    that the sea is salter in inter-tropical than in polar regions, and
    that this circumstance, so far as it goes, must tend to neutralize
    the effect of difference of temperature. It is probable, indeed, that
    the effect produced by difference of temperature is thus entirely
    neutralized, and that no difference of density whatever exists between
    the sea in inter-tropical and polar regions, and consequently that
    there is no difference of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> level nor anything to produce such a general
    motion as Dr. Carpenter supposes. This, I am glad to find, is the
    opinion of Professor Wyville Thomson.</p>

  <p>“I am greatly mistaken,” says that author, “if the low specific gravity
    of the polar sea, the result of the condensation and precipitation
    of vapour evaporated from the inter-tropical area, do not fully
    counterbalance the contraction of the superficial film by arctic
    cold.... Speaking in the total absence of all reliable data, it is my
    general impression that if we were to set aside all other agencies, and
    to trust for an oceanic circulation to those conditions only which are
    relied upon by Dr. Carpenter, if there were any general circulation at
    all, which seems very problematical, the odds are rather in favour of
    a warm under current travelling northwards by virtue of its excess of
    salt, balanced by a surface return current of fresher though colder
    arctic water.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

  <p>This is what actually takes place on the west and north-west of
    Spitzbergen. There the warm water of the Gulf-stream flows underneath
    the cold polar current. And it is the opinion of Dr. Scoresby, Mr.
    Clements Markham, and Lieut. Maury that this warm water, in virtue
    of its greater saltness, is denser than the polar water. Mr. Leigh
    Smith found on the north-west of Spitzbergen the temperature at 500
    fathoms to be 52°, and once even 64°, while the water on the surface
    was only a degree or two above freezing.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Mr. Aitken, of Darroch,
    in a paper lately read before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts,
    showed experimentally that the polar water in regions where the ice is
    melting is actually less dense than the warm and more salt tropical
    waters. Nor will it help the matter in the least to maintain that
    difference of specific gravity is not the reason why the warm water of
    the Gulf-stream passes under the polar stream—because if difference
    of specific gravity be not the cause of the warm water underlying the
    cold water in polar regions, then difference of specific gravity may
    likewise not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>be the cause of the cold water underlying the warm at
    the equator; and if so, then there is no necessity for the gravitation
    hypothesis of oceanic circulation.</p>

  <p>There is little doubt that the super-heated stratum at the surface of
    the inter-tropical seas, which stratum, according to Dr. Carpenter,
    is of no great thickness, is less dense than the polar water: but if
    we take a column extending from the surface down to the bottom of the
    ocean, this column at the equator will be found to be as heavy as one
    of equal length in the polar area. And if this be the case, then there
    can be no difference of level between the equator and the poles, and
    no disturbance of static equilibrium nor anything else to produce
    circulation.</p>

  <p><em>Under Currents account for all the Facts better than Dr. Carpenter’s
    Hypothesis.</em>—Assuming, for the present, the system of prevailing winds
    to be the true cause of oceanic currents, it necessarily follows (as
    will be shown hereafter) that a large quantity of Atlantic water must
    be propelled into the Arctic Ocean; and such, as we know, is actually
    the case. The Arctic Ocean, however, as Professor Wyville Thomson
    remarks, is a well-nigh closed basin, not permitting of a free outflow
    into the Pacific Ocean of the water impelled into it.</p>

  <p>But it is evident that the water which is thus being constantly
    carried from the inter-tropical to the arctic regions must somehow
    or other find its way back to the equator; in other words, there
    must be a return current equal in magnitude to the direct current.
    Now the question to be determined is, what path must this return
    current take? It appears to me that it will take the <em>path of least
    resistance</em>, whether that path may happen to be at the surface or under
    the surface. But that the path of least resistance will, as a general
    rule, lie at a very considerable distance below the surface is, I
    think, evident from the following considerations. At the surface the
    general direction of the currents is opposite to that of the return
    current. The surface motion of the water in the Atlantic is from the
    equator to the pole; but the return current must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> from the pole to
    the equator. Consequently the surface currents will oppose the motion
    of any return current unless that current lie at a considerable depth
    below the surface currents. Again, the winds, as a general rule, blow
    in an opposite direction to the course of the return current, because,
    according to supposition, the winds blow in the direction of the
    surface currents. From all these causes the path of least resistance to
    the return current will, as a general rule, not be at the surface, but
    at a very considerable depth below it.</p>

  <p>A large portion of the water from the polar regions no doubt leaves
    those regions as surface currents; but a surface current of this kind,
    on meeting with some resistance to its onward progress along the
    surface, will dip down and continue its course as an under current. We
    have an example of this in the case of the polar current, which upon
    meeting the Gulf-stream on the banks of Newfoundland divides—a portion
    of it dipping down and pursuing its course underneath that stream into
    the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. And that this under current
    is a real and tangible current, in the proper sense of the term, and
    not an imperceptible movement of the water, is proved by the fact that
    large icebergs deeply immersed in it are often carried southward with
    considerable velocity against the united force of the wind and the
    Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>Dr. Carpenter refers at considerable length (§ 134) to Mr. Mitchell’s
    opinion as to the origin of the polar current, which is the same as
    that advanced by Maury, viz., that the impelling cause is difference
    of specific gravity. But although Dr. Carpenter quotes Mr. Mitchell’s
    opinion, he nevertheless does not appear to adopt it: for in §§ 90−93
    and various other places he distinctly states that he does not agree
    with Lieut. Maury’s view that the Gulf-stream and polar current
    are caused by difference of density. In fact, Dr. Carpenter seems
    particularly anxious that it should be clearly understood that he
    dissents from the theory maintained by Maury. But he does not merely
    deny that the Gulf-stream and polar current can be caused by difference
    of density; he even goes so far as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> affirm that no sensible current
    whatever can be due to that cause, and adduces the authority of Sir
    John Herschel in support of that opinion:—“The doctrine of Lieut.
    Maury,” he says, “was powerfully and convincingly opposed by Sir
    John Herschel; who showed, beyond all reasonable doubt, first, that
    the Gulf-stream really has its origin in the propulsive force of the
    trade-winds, and secondly, that the greatest disturbance of equilibrium
    which can be supposed to result from the agencies invoked by Lieut.
    Maury would be utterly inadequate to generate and maintain either the
    Gulf-stream or any other sensible current” (§ 92). This being Dr.
    Carpenter’s belief, it is somewhat singular that he should advance the
    case of the polar current passing under the Gulf-stream as evidence
    in favour of his theory; for in reality he could hardly have selected
    a case more hostile to that theory. In short, it is evident that, if
    a polar current impelled by a force other than that of gravity can
    pass from the banks of Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico (a distance
    of some thousands of miles) under a current flowing in the opposite
    direction and, at the same time, so powerful as the Gulf-stream, it
    could pass much more easily under comparatively still water, or water
    flowing in the same direction as itself. And if this be so, then all
    our difficulties disappear, and we satisfactorily explain the presence
    of cold polar water at the bottom of inter-tropical seas without having
    recourse to the hypothesis advanced by Dr. Carpenter.</p>

  <p>But we have an example of an under current more inexplicable on the
    gravitation hypothesis than even that of the polar current, viz., the
    warm under current of Davis Strait.</p>

  <p>There is a strong current flowing north from the Atlantic through Davis
    Strait into the Arctic Ocean underneath a surface current passing
    southwards in an opposite direction. Large icebergs have been seen to
    be carried northwards by this under current at the rate of four knots
    an hour against both the wind and the surface current, ripping and
    tearing their way with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> terrific force through surface ice of great
    thickness.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> A current so powerful and rapid as this cannot, as Dr.
    Carpenter admits, be referred to difference of specific gravity. But
    even supposing that it could, still difference of temperature between
    the equatorial and polar seas would not account for it; for the current
    in question flows in the <em>wrong direction</em>. Nor will it help the matter
    the least to adopt Maury’s explanation, viz., that the warm under
    current from the south, in consequence of its greater saltness, is
    denser than the cold one from the polar regions. For if the water of
    the Atlantic, notwithstanding its higher temperature, is in consequence
    of its greater saltness so much denser than the polar water on the
    west of Greenland as to produce an under current of four knots an hour
    in the direction of the pole, then surely the same thing to a certain
    extent will hold true in reference to the ocean on the east side of
    Greenland. Thus instead of there being, as Dr. Carpenter supposes,
    an underflow of polar water south into the Atlantic in virtue of its
    <em>greater</em> density, there ought, on the contrary, to be a surface flow
    in consequence of its lesser density.</p>

  <p>The true explanation no doubt is, that the warm under current from
    the south and the cold upper current from the north are both parts
    of one grand system of circulation produced by the winds, difference
    of specific gravity having no share whatever either in impelling the
    currents, or in determining which shall be the upper and which the
    lower.</p>

  <p>The wind in Baffin’s Bay and Davis Strait blows nearly always in one
    direction, viz. from the north. The tendency of this is to produce a
    surface or upper current from the north down into the Atlantic, and to
    prevent or retard any surface current from the south. The warm current
    from the Atlantic, taking the path of least resistance, dips under the
    polar current and pursues its course as an under current.</p>

  <p>Mr. Clements Markham, in his “Threshold of the Unknown Region,” is
    inclined to attribute the motion of the icebergs to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>tidal action or
    to counter under currents. That the motion of the icebergs cannot
    reasonably be attributed to the tides is, I think, evident from the
    descriptions given both by Midshipman Griffin and by Captain Duncan,
    who distinctly saw the icebergs moving at the rate of about four knots
    an hour against a surface current flowing southwards. And Captain
    Duncan states that the bergs continued their course northwards for
    several days, till they ultimately disappeared. The probability is that
    this northward current is composed partly of Gulf-stream water and
    partly of that portion of polar water which is supposed to flow round
    Cape Farewell from the east coast of Greenland. This stream, composed
    of both warm and cold water, on reaching to about latitude 65°N., where
    it encounters the strong northerly winds, dips down under the polar
    current and continues its northward course as an under current.</p>

  <p>We have on the west of Spitzbergen, as has already been noticed, a
    similar example of a warm current from the south passing under a polar
    current. A portion of the Gulf-stream which passes round the west
    coast of Spitzbergen flows under an arctic current coming down from
    the north; and it does so no doubt because it is here in the region of
    prevailing northerly winds, which favour the polar current but oppose
    the Gulf-stream. Again, we have a cold and rapid current sweeping
    round the east and south of Spitzbergen, a current of which Mr. Lamont
    asserts that he is positive he has seen it running at the rate of seven
    or eight miles an hour. This current, on meeting the Gulf-stream about
    the northern entrance to the German Ocean, dips down under that stream
    and pursues its course southwards as an under current.</p>

  <p>Several other cases of under currents might be adduced which cannot
    be explained on the gravitation theory, and which must be referred to
    a system of oceanic circulation produced by the impulse of the wind;
    but these will suffice to show that the assumption that the winds can
    produce only a mere surface-drift is directly opposed to facts. And
    it will not do to affirm that a current which forms part of a general
    system of circulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> produced by the impulse of the winds cannot
    possibly be an under current; for in the case referred to we have
    proof that the thing is not only possible but actually exists. This
    point, however, will be better understood after we have considered the
    evidence in favour of a general system of oceanic currents.</p>

  <p>Much of the difficulty experienced in comprehending how under currents
    can be produced by the wind, or how an impulse imparted to the surface
    of the ocean can ever be transmitted to the bottom, appears to me to
    result, to a considerable extent at least, from a slight deception
    of the imagination. The thing which impresses us most forcibly in
    regard to the ocean is its profound depth. A mean depth of, say, three
    miles produces a striking impression; but if we could represent to
    the mind the vast area of the ocean as correctly as we can its depth,
    <em>shallowness</em> rather than <em>depth</em> would be the impression produced. If
    in crossing a meadow we found a sheet of water one hundred yards in
    diameter and only an inch in depth, we should not call that a <em>deep</em>,
    but a very <em>shallow</em> pool. The probability is that we should speak of
    it as simply a piece of ground covered with a thin layer of water.
    Yet such a thin layer of water would be a correct representation in
    miniature of the ocean; for the ocean in relation to its superficial
    area is as shallow as the pool of our illustration. In reference to
    such a pool or thin film of water, we have no difficulty in conceiving
    how a disturbance on its surface would be transmitted to its bottom.
    In fact our difficulty is in conceiving how any disturbance extending
    over its entire surface should not extend to the bottom. Now if we
    could form as accurate a sensuous impression of the vast area of the
    ocean as we do of such a pool, all our difficulty in understanding how
    the impulses of the wind acting on the vast area of the ocean should
    communicate motion down to its bottom would disappear. It is certainly
    true that sudden commotions caused by storms do not generally extend to
    great depths. Neither will winds of short continuance produce a current
    extending far below the surface. But prevailing winds which can produce
    such immense surface-flow as that of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> equatorial currents of
    the globe and the Gulf-stream, which follow definite directions, must
    communicate their motion to great depths, unless water be frictionless,
    a thing which it is not. Suppose the upper layer of the ocean to be
    forced on by the direct action of the winds with a constant velocity
    of, say, four miles an hour, the layer immediately below will be
    dragged along with a constant velocity somewhat less than four miles
    an hour. The layer immediately below this second layer will in turn be
    also dragged along with a constant velocity somewhat less than the one
    above it. The same will take place in regard to each succeeding layer,
    the constant velocity of each layer being somewhat less than the one
    immediately above it, and greater than the one below it. The question
    to be determined is, at what depth will all motion cease? I presume
    that at present we have not sufficient data for properly determining
    this point. The depth will depend, other things being equal, upon the
    amount of molecular resistance offered by the water to motion—in other
    words, on the amount of the shearing-force of the one layer over the
    other. The fact, however, that motion imparted to the surface will
    extend to great depths can be easily shown by direct experiment. If a
    constant motion be imparted to the surface of water, say, in a vessel,
    motion will ultimately be communicated to the bottom, no matter how
    wide or how deep the vessel may be. The same effect will take place
    whether the vessel be 5 feet deep or 500 feet deep.</p>

  <p><em>The known Condition of the Ocean inconsistent with Dr. Carpenter’s
    Hypothesis.</em>—Dr. Carpenter says that he looks forward with great
    satisfaction to the results of the inquiries which are being prosecuted
    by the Circumnavigation Expedition, in the hope that the facts brought
    to light may establish his theory of a general oceanic circulation; and
    he specifies certain of these facts which, if found to be correct, will
    establish his theory. It seems to me, however, that the facts to which
    he refers are just as explicable on the theory of under currents as on
    the theory of a general oceanic circulation. He begins by saying, “If
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> views I have propounded be correct, it may be expected that near
    the border of the great antarctic ice-barrier a temperature below 30°
    will be met with (as it has been by Parry, Martens, and Weyprecht near
    Spitzbergen) at no great depth beneath the surface, and that instead of
    rising at still greater depths, the thermometer will fall to near the
    freezing-point of salt water” (§ 39).</p>

  <p>Dr. Carpenter can hardly claim this as evidence in favour of his
    theory; for near the borders of the ice-barrier the water, as a matter
    of course, could not be expected to have a much higher temperature than
    the ice itself. And if the observations be made during summer months,
    the temperature of the water at the surface will no doubt be found to
    be higher than that of the bottom; but if they be carried on during
    winter, the surface-temperature will doubtless be found to be as low as
    the bottom-temperature. These are results which do not depend upon any
    particular theory of oceanic circulation.</p>

  <p>“The bottom temperature of the North Pacific,” he continues, “will
    afford a crucial test of the truth of the doctrine. For since the sole
    communication of this vast oceanic area with the arctic basin is a
    strait so shallow as only to permit an inflow of warm surface water,
    its deep cold stratum must be entirely derived from the antarctic area;
    and if its bottom temperature is not actually higher than that of the
    South Pacific, the glacial stratum ought to be found at a greater depth
    north of the equator than south of it” (§ 39).</p>

  <p>This may probably show that the water came from the antarctic regions,
    but cannot possibly prove that it came in the manner which he supposes.</p>

  <p>“In the North Atlantic, again, the comparative limitation of
    communication with the arctic area may be expected to prevent its
    bottom temperature from being reduced as low as that of the Southern
    Atlantic” (§ 39). Supposing the bottom temperature of the South
    Atlantic should be found to be lower than the bottom temperature of the
    North Atlantic, this fact will be just as consistent with the theory of
    under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> currents as with his theory of a general movement of the ocean.</p>

  <p>I am also wholly unable to comprehend how he should imagine, because
    the bottom temperature of the South Atlantic happens to be lower, and
    the polar water to lie nearer to the surface in this ocean than in the
    North Atlantic, that therefore this proves the truth of his theory.
    This condition of matters is just as consistent, and even more so, as
    will be shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII.</a>, with my theory as with his. When we
    consider the immense quantity of warm surface water which, as has been
    shown (<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a>), is being constantly transferred from the South into
    the North Atlantic, we readily understand how the polar water comes
    nearer to the surface in the former ocean than in the latter. Every
    pound of water, of course, passing from the southern to the northern
    hemisphere must be compensated by an equal amount passing from the
    northern to the southern hemisphere. But nevertheless the warm water
    drained off the South Atlantic is not replaced directly by water from
    the north, but by that cold antarctic current, the existence of which
    is, unfortunately, too well known to navigators from the immense masses
    of icebergs which it brings along with it. In fact, the whole of the
    phenomena are just as easily explained upon the principle of under
    currents as upon Dr. Carpenter’s theory. But we shall have to return to
    this point in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII.</a>, when we come to discuss a class of facts
    which appear to be wholly irreconcilable with the gravitation theory.</p>

  <p>Indeed I fear that even although Dr. Carpenter’s expectations should
    eventually be realised in the results of the Circumnavigation
    Expedition, yet the advocates of the wind theory will still remain
    unconverted. In fact the Director of this Expedition has already, on
    the wind theory, offered an explanation of nearly all the phenomena
    on which Dr. Carpenter relies;<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and the same has also been done by
    Dr. Petermann,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who, as is well known, is equally opposed to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>Dr.
    Carpenter’s theory. Dr. Carpenter directs attention to the necessity of
    examining the broad and deep channel separating Iceland from Greenland.
    The observations which have already been made, however, show that
    nearly the entire channel is occupied, on the surface at least, by
    water flowing southward from the polar area—a direction the opposite of
    what it ought to be according to the gravitation theory. In fact the
    surface of one half of the entire area of the ocean, extending from
    Greenland to the North Cape, is moving in a direction the opposite of
    that which it ought to take according to the theory under review. The
    western half of this area is occupied by water which at the surface is
    flowing southwards; while the eastern half, which has hitherto been
    regarded by almost everybody but Dr. Carpenter himself and Mr. Findlay
    as an extension of the Gulf-stream, is moving polewards. The motion of
    the western half must be attributed to the winds and not to gravity;
    for it is moving in the wrong direction to be accounted for by the
    latter cause; but had it been moving in the opposite direction, no
    doubt its motion would have been referred to gravitation. To this cause
    the motion of the eastern half, which is in the proper direction, is
    attributed;<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> but why not assign this motion also to the impulse of
    the winds, more especially since the direction of the prevailing winds
    blowing over that area coincides with that of the water? If the wind
    can produce the motion of the water in the western half, why may not it
    do the same in the eastern half?</p>

  <p>If there be such a difference of density between equatorial and polar
    waters as to produce a general flow of the upper portion of the ocean
    poleward, how does it happen that one half of the water in the above
    area is moving in opposition to gravity? How is it that in a wide
    open sea gravitation should act so powerfully in the one half of it
    and with so little effect in the other half? There is probably little
    doubt that the ice-cold water of the western half extends from the
    surface down to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>the bottom. And it is also probable that the bottom
    water is moving southwards in the same direction as the surface water.
    The bottom water in such a case would be moving in harmony with the
    gravitation theory; but would Dr. Carpenter on this account attribute
    its motion to gravity? Would he attribute the motion of the lower half
    to gravity and the upper half to the wind? He could not in consistency
    with his theory attribute the motion of the upper half to gravity: for
    although the ice-cold water extended to the surface, this could not
    explain how gravity should move it southward instead of polewards, as
    according to theory it ought to move. He might affirm, if he chose,
    that the surface water moves southwards because it is dragged forward
    by the bottom water; but if this view be held, he is not entitled to
    affirm, as he does, that the winds can only produce a mere surface
    drift. If the viscosity and molecular resistance of water be such that,
    when the lower strata of the ocean are impelled forward by gravity or
    by any other cause, the superincumbent strata extending to the surface
    are perforce dragged after them, then, for the same reason, when the
    upper strata are impelled forward by the wind or any other cause, the
    underlying strata must also be dragged along after them.</p>

  <p>If the condition of the ocean between Greenland and the north-western
    shore of Europe is irreconcilable with the gravitation theory, we find
    the case even worse for that theory when we direct our attention to
    the condition of the ocean on the southern hemisphere; for according
    to the researches of Captain Duperrey and others on the currents of
    the Southern Ocean, a very large portion of the area of that ocean is
    occupied by water moving on the surface more in a northward than a
    poleward direction. Referring to the deep trough between the Shetland
    and the Faroe Islands, called by him the “Lightning Channel,” Dr.
    Carpenter says, “If my view be correct, a current-drag suspended in
    the <em>upper</em> stratum ought to have a perceptible movement in the N.E.
    direction; whilst another, suspended in the <em>lower</em> stratum, should
    move S.W.” (§ 40).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

  <p>Any one believing in the north-eastern extension of the Gulf-stream
    and in the Spitsbergen polar under current, to which I have already
    referred, would not feel surprised to learn that the surface strata
    have a perceptible north-eastward motion, and the bottom strata a
    perceptible south-westward motion. North-east and east of Iceland
    there is a general flow of cold polar water in a south-east direction
    towards the left edge of the Gulf-stream. This water, as Professor Mohn
    concludes, “descends beneath the Gulf-stream and partially finds an
    outlet in the lower half of the Faroe-Shetland channel.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

  <p><em>An Objection Considered.</em>—In Nature, vol. ix. p. 423, Dr. Carpenter
    has advanced the following objection to the foregoing theory of
    under-currents:—“According to Mr. Croll’s doctrine, the whole of that
    vast mass of water in the North Atlantic, averaging, say, 1,500 fathoms
    in thickness and 3,600 miles in breadth, the temperature of which
    (from 40° downwards), as ascertained by the <cite>Challenger</cite> soundings,
    clearly shows it to be mainly derived from a polar source, is nothing
    else than <em>the reflux of the Gulf-stream</em>. Now, even if we suppose
    that the whole of this stream, as it passes Sandy Hook, were to go on
    into the closed arctic basin, it would only force out an equivalent
    body of water. And as, on comparing the sectional areas of the two,
    I find that of the Gulf-stream to be about 1/900th that of the North
    Atlantic underflow; and as it is admitted that a large part of the
    Gulf-stream returns into the Mid-Atlantic circulation, only a branch of
    it going on to the north-east, the extreme improbability (may I not say
    impossibility?) that so vast a mass of water can be put in motion by
    what is by comparison a mere rivulet (the north-east motion of which,
    as a distinct current, has not been traced eastward of 30° W. long.)
    seems still more obvious.”</p>

  <p>In this objection three things are assumed: (1) that the mass of cold
    water 1,500 fathoms deep and 3,600 miles in breadth is in a state of
    motion towards the equator; (2) that it cannot be the reflux of the
    Gulf-stream, because its sectional <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>area is 900 times as great as that
    of the Gulf-stream; (3) that the immense mass of water is, according to
    my views, set in motion by the Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>As this objection has an important bearing on the question under
    consideration, I shall consider these three assumptions separately
    and in their order: (1) That this immense mass of cold water came
    originally from the polar regions I, of course, admit, but that the
    whole is in a state of motion I certainly do not admit. There is no
    warrant whatever for any such assumption. According to Dr. Carpenter
    himself, the heating-power of the sun does not extend to any great
    depth below the surface; consequently there is nothing whatever to
    heat this mass but the heat coming through the earth’s crust. But
    the amount of heat derived from this source is so trifling, that an
    under current from the arctic regions far less in volume than that
    of the Gulf-stream would be quite sufficient to keep the mass at an
    ice-cold temperature. Taking the area of the North Atlantic between
    the equator and the Tropic of Cancer, including also the Caribbean
    Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, to be 7,700,000 square miles, and the
    rate at which internal heat passes through the earth’s surface to be
    that assigned by Sir William Thomson, we find that the total quantity
    of heat derived from the earth’s crust by the above area is equal to
    about 88 × 10<sup>15</sup> foot-pounds per day. But this amount is equal to
    only 1/894th that conveyed by the Gulf-stream, on the supposition that
    each pound of water carries 19,300 foot-pounds of heat. Consequently
    an under current from the polar regions of not more than 1/35th the
    volume of the Gulf-stream would suffice to keep the entire mass of
    water of that area within 1° of what it would be were there no heat
    derived from the crust of the earth; that is to say, were the water
    conveyed by the under current at 32°, internal heat would not maintain
    the mass of the ocean in the above area at more than 33°. The entire
    area of the North Atlantic from the equator to the arctic circle is
    somewhere about 16,000,000 square miles. An under current of less than
    1/17th that of the Gulf-stream coming from the arctic regions would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
    therefore suffice to keep the entire North Atlantic basin filled with
    ice-cold water. In short, whatever theory we adopt regarding oceanic
    circulation, it follows equally as a necessary consequence that the
    entire mass of the ocean below the stratum heated by the sun’s rays
    must consist of cold water. For if cold water be continually coming
    from the polar regions either in the form of under currents, or in the
    form of a general underflow as Dr. Carpenter supposes, the entire under
    portion of the ocean must ultimately become occupied by cold water; for
    there is no source from which this influx of water can derive heat,
    save from the earth’s crust. But the amount thus derived is so trifling
    as to produce no sensible effect. For example, a polar under current
    one half the size of the Gulf-stream would be sufficient to keep the
    entire water of the globe (below the stratum heated by the sun’s rays)
    at an ice-cold temperature. Internal heat would not be sufficient under
    such circumstances to maintain the mass 1° Fahr. above the temperature
    it possessed when it left the polar regions.</p>

  <p>It follows therefore that the presence of the immense mass of ice-cold
    water in the great depths of the ocean is completely accounted for by
    under currents, and there is no necessity for supposing it to be all
    in a state of motion towards the equator. In fact, this very state of
    things, which the general oceanic circulation hypothesis was devised to
    explain, results as a necessary consequence of polar under currents.
    Unless these were entirely stopped it is physically impossible that the
    ocean could be in any other condition.</p>

  <p>But suppose that this immense mass of cold water occupying the great
    depths of the ocean were, as Dr. Carpenter assumes it to be, in a
    state of constant motion towards the equator, and that its sectional
    area were 900 times that of the Gulf-stream, it would not therefore
    follow that the quantity of water passing through this large sectional
    area must be greater than that flowing through a sectional area of
    the Gulf-stream; for the quantity of water flowing through this large
    sectional area depends entirely on the rate of motion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

  <p>I am wholly unable to understand how it could be supposed that this
    underflow, according to my view, is set in motion by the Gulf-stream,
    seeing that I have shown that the return under current is as much due
    to the impulse of the wind as the Gulf-stream itself.</p>

  <p>Dr. Carpenter lays considerable stress on the important fact
    established by the <cite>Challenger</cite> expedition, that the great depths of
    the sea in equatorial regions are occupied by ice-cold water, while
    the portion heated by the sun’s rays is simply a thin stratum at the
    surface. It seems to me that it would be difficult to find a fact more
    hostile to his theory than this. Were it not for this upper stratum
    of heated water there would be no difference between the equatorial
    and polar columns, and consequently nothing to produce motion. But the
    thinner this stratum is the less is the difference, and the less there
    is to produce motion.</p>

  <p><em>Experiment to illustrate Theory.</em>—In support of the theory of a
    general movement of water between equatorial and polar regions, Dr.
    Carpenter adduces the authority of Humboldt and of Prof. Buff.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
    I have been unable to find anything in the writings of either from
    which it can be inferred that they have given this matter special
    consideration. Humboldt merely alludes to the theory, and that in the
    most casual manner; and that Prof. Buff has not carefully investigated
    the subject is apparent from the very illustration quoted by Dr.
    Carpenter from the “Physics of the Earth.” “The water of the ocean at
    great depths,” says Prof. Buff, “has a temperature, even under the
    equator, nearly approaching to the freezing-point. This low temperature
    cannot depend on any influence of the sea-bottom.... The fact, however,
    is explained by a continual current of cold water flowing from the
    polar regions towards the equator. The following well-known experiment
    clearly illustrates the manner of this movement. A glass vessel is to
    be filled with water with which some powder has been mixed, and is then
    to be heated <em>at bottom</em>. It will soon be seen, from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>the motion of the
    particles of powder, that currents are set up in opposite directions
    through the water. Warm water rises from the bottom up through the
    middle of the vessel, and spreads over the surface, while the colder
    and therefore heavier liquid falls down at the sides of the glass.”</p>

  <p>This illustration is evidently intended to show not merely the form
    and direction of the great system of oceanic circulation, but also the
    mode in which the circulation is induced by heat. It is no doubt true
    that if we apply heat (say that of a spirit-lamp) to the bottom of a
    vessel filled with water, the water at the bottom of the vessel will
    become heated and rise to the surface; and if the heat be continued
    an ascending current of warm water will be generated; and this, of
    course, will give rise to a compensating under current of colder water
    from all sides. In like manner it is also true that, if heat were
    applied to the bottom of the ocean in equatorial regions, an ascending
    current of hot water would be also generated, giving rise to an under
    current of cold water from the polar regions. But all this is the
    diametrically opposite of what actually takes place in nature. The heat
    is not applied to the bottom of the ocean, so as to make the water
    there lighter than the water at the surface, and thus to generate an
    ascending current; but the heat is applied to the surface of the ocean,
    and the effect of this is to prevent an ascending current rather than
    to produce one, for it tends to keep the water at the surface lighter
    than the water at the bottom. In order to show how the heat of the sun
    produces currents in the ocean, Prof. Buff should have applied the
    heat, not to the bottom of his vessel, but to the upper surface of the
    water. But this is not all, the form of the vessel has something to
    do with the matter. The wider we make the vessel in proportion to its
    depth, the more difficult it is to produce currents by means of heat.
    But in order to represent what takes place in nature, we ought to have
    the same proportion between the depth and the superficial area of the
    water in our vessel as there is between the depth and the superficial
    area of the sea. The mean depth of the sea may be taken roughly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> be
    about three miles.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The distance between pole and pole we shall take
    in round numbers to be 12,000 miles. The sun may therefore be regarded
    as shining upon a circular sea 12,000 miles in diameter and three miles
    deep. The depth of the sea to its diameter is therefore as 1 to 4,000.
    Suppose, now, that in our experiment we make the depth of our vessel
    one inch, we shall require to make its diameter 4,000 inches, or 333
    feet, say, in round numbers, 100 yards in diameter. Let us, then, take
    a pool of water 100 yards in diameter, and one inch deep. Suppose the
    water to be at 32°. Apply heat to the upper surface of the pool, so
    as to raise the temperature of the surface of the water to 80° at the
    centre of the pool, the temperature diminishing towards the edge, where
    it is at 32°. It is found that at a depth of two miles the temperature
    of the water at the equator is about as low as that of the poles. We
    must therefore suppose the water at the centre of our pool to diminish
    in temperature from the surface downwards, so that at a depth of half
    an inch the water is at 32°. We have in this case a thin layer of warm
    water half an inch thick at the centre, and gradually thinning off to
    nothing at the edge of the pool. The lightest water, be it observed,
    is at the surface, so that an ascending or a descending current
    is impossible. The only way whereby the heat applied can have any
    tendency to produce motion is this:—The heating of the water expands
    it, consequently the surface of the pool must stand at a little higher
    level at its centre than at its edge, where no expansion takes place;
    and therefore, in order to restore the level of the pool, the water at
    the centre will tend to flow towards the sides. But what is the amount
    of this tendency? Its amount will depend upon the amount of slope,
    but the slope in the case under consideration amounts to only 1 in
    7,340,000.</p>

  <p><em>Dr. Carpenter’s Experiment.</em>—In order to obviate the objection to
    Professor Buff’s experiment Dr. Carpenter has devised <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>another mode.
    But I presume his experiment was intended rather to illustrate the way
    in which the circulation of the ocean, according to his theory, takes
    place, than to prove that it actually does take place. At any rate, all
    that can be claimed for the experiment is the proof that water will
    circulate in consequence of difference of specific gravity resulting
    from difference of temperature. But this does not require proof, for no
    physicist denies it. The point which requires to be proved is this. Is
    the difference of specific gravity which exists in the ocean sufficient
    to produce the supposed circulation? Now his mode of experimenting
    will not prove this, unless he makes his experiment agree with the
    conditions already stated.</p>

  <p>But I decidedly object to the water being heated in the way in which it
    has been done by him in his experiment before the Royal Geographical
    Society; for I feel somewhat confident that in this experiment the
    circulation resulted not from difference of specific gravity, as was
    supposed, but rather from the way in which the heat was applied. In
    that experiment the one half of a thick metallic plate was placed in
    contact with the upper surface of the water at one end of the trough;
    the other half, projecting over the end of the trough, was heated
    by means of a spirit-lamp. It is perfectly obvious that though the
    temperature of the great mass of the water under the plate might not
    be raised over 80° or so, yet the molecules in contact with the metal
    would have a very high temperature. These molecules, in consequence of
    their expansion, would be unable to sink into the cooler and denser
    water underneath, and thus escape the heat which was being constantly
    communicated to them from the heated plate. But escape they must, or
    their temperature would continue to rise until they would ultimately
    burst into vapour. They cannot ascend, neither can they descend: they
    therefore must be expelled by the heat from the plate in a horizontal
    direction. The next layer of molecules from beneath would take their
    place and would be expelled in a similar manner, and this process would
    continue so long as the heat was applied to the plate. A circulation
    would thus be established by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> direct expansive force of vapour, and
    not in any way due to difference of specific gravity, as Dr. Carpenter
    supposes.</p>

  <p>But supposing the heated bar to be replaced by a piece of ice,
    circulation would no doubt take place; but this proves nothing more
    than that difference of density will produce circulation, which is what
    no one calls in question.</p>

  <p>The case referred to by Dr. Carpenter of the heating apparatus in
    London University is also unsatisfactory. The water leaves the boiler
    at 120° and returns to it at 80°. The difference of specific gravity
    between the water leaving the boiler and the water returning to it
    is supposed to produce the circulation. It seems to me that this
    difference of specific gravity has nothing whatever to do with the
    matter. The cause of the circulation must be sought for in the boiler
    itself, and not in the pipes. The heat is applied to the bottom of
    the boiler, not to the top. What is the temperature of the molecules
    in contact with the bottom of the boiler directly over the fire, is
    a question which must be considered before we can arrive at a just
    determination of the causes which produce circulation in the pipes
    of a heating apparatus such as that to which Dr. Carpenter refers.
    But, in addition to this, as the heat is applied to the bottom of the
    boiler and not to the top, convection comes into play, a cause which,
    as we shall find, does not come into play in the theory of oceanic
    circulation at present under our consideration.</p>

  <p><em>The Force exerted by Gravity.</em>—Dr. Carpenter speaks of his doctrine of
    a general oceanic circulation sustained by difference of temperature
    alone, “as one of which physical geographers could not recognise the
    importance, so long as they remained under the dominant idea that
    the temperature of the deep sea is everywhere 39°.” And he affirms
    that “until it is clearly apprehended that sea-water becomes more and
    more dense as its temperature is reduced, the immense motive power of
    polar cold cannot be understood.” But in chap. vii. and also in the
    Phil. Mag. for October, 1870 and 1871, I proved that if we take 39°
    as the temperature of maximum density the force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> exerted by gravity
    tending to produce circulation is just as great as when we take 32°.
    The reason for this is that when we take 32° as the temperature of
    maximum density, although we have, it is true, a greater elevation of
    the ocean above the place of maximum density, yet this latter occurs at
    the poles; while on the other hand, when we take 39°, the difference
    of level is less—the place not being at the poles but in about lat.
    56°. Now the shorter slope from the equator to lat. 56° is as steep as
    the larger one from the equator to the poles, and consequently gravity
    exerts as much force in the production of motion in the one case as in
    the other. Sir John Herschel, taking 39° as the temperature of maximum
    density, estimated the slope at 1/32nd of an inch per mile, whereas
    we, taking 32° as the actual temperature of maximum density of the
    polar seas and calculating from modern data, find that the slope is not
    one-half that amount, and that the force of gravity tending to produce
    circulation is much less than Herschel concluded it to be. The reason,
    therefore, why physical geographers did not adopt the theory that
    oceanic circulation is the result of difference of temperature could
    not possibly be the one assigned by Dr. Carpenter, viz., that they had
    under-estimated the force of gravity by taking 39° instead of 32° as
    the temperature of maximum density.</p>

  <p><em>The Work performed by Gravity.</em>—But in order clearly to understand
    this point, it will be better to treat the matter according to the
    third method, and consider not the mere <em>force</em> of gravity impelling
    the waters, but the amount of <em>work</em> which gravitation is capable of
    performing.</p>

  <p>Let us then assume the correctness of my estimate, that the height of
    the surface of the ocean at the equator above that at the poles is 4
    feet 6 inches, for in representing the mode in which difference of
    specific gravity produces circulation it is of no importance what we
    may fix upon as the amount of the slope. In order, therefore, to avoid
    fractions of a foot, I shall take the slope at 4 feet instead of 4½
    feet, which it actually is. A pound of water in flowing down this slope
    from the equator to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> either of the poles will perform 4 foot-pounds of
    work; or, more properly speaking, gravitation will. Now it is evident
    that when this pound of water has reached the pole, it is at the
    bottom of the slope, and consequently cannot descend further. Gravity,
    therefore, cannot perform any more work upon it; as it can only do so
    while the thing acted upon continues to descend—that is, moves under
    the force exerted. But the water will not move under the influence
    of gravity unless it move downward; it being in this direction only
    that gravity acts on the water. “But,” says Dr. Carpenter, “the effect
    of surface-cold upon the water of the polar basin will be to reduce
    the temperature of its whole mass below the freezing-point of fresh
    water, the surface-stratum <em>sinking</em> as it is cooled in virtue of its
    diminished bulk and increased density, and being replaced by water not
    yet cooled to the same degree.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> By the cooling of the whole mass
    of polar water by cold and the heating of the water at the equator by
    the sun’s rays the polar column of water, as we have seen, is rendered
    denser than the equatorial one, and in order that the two may balance
    each other, the polar column is necessarily shorter than the equatorial
    by 4 feet; and thus it is that the slope of 4 feet is formed. It is
    perfectly true that the water which leaves the equator warm and light,
    becomes by the time it reaches the pole cold and dense. But unless
    it be denser than the underlying polar water it will not sink down
    <em>through</em> it.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> We are not told, however, why it should be colder
    than the whole mass underneath, which, according to Dr. Carpenter,
    is cooled by polar cold. But that he does suppose it to sink to the
    bottom in consequence of its contraction by cold would appear from the
    following quotation:—</p>

  <p>“Until it is clearly apprehended that sea-water becomes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>more and more
    dense as its temperature is reduced, and that it consequently continues
    to sink until it freezes, the immense motor power of polar cold cannot
    be apprehended. But when this has been clearly recognised, it is seen
    that the application of <em>cold at the surface</em> is precisely equivalent
    as a moving power to that application of <em>heat at the bottom</em> by which
    the circulation of water is sustained in every heating apparatus that
    makes use of it” (§ 25).</p>

  <p>The application of cold at the surface is thus held to be equivalent
    as a motor power to the application of heat at the bottom. But heat
    applied to the bottom of a vessel produces circulation by <em>convection</em>.
    It makes the molecules at the bottom expand, and they, in consequence
    of buoyancy, rise <em>through</em> the water in the vessel. Consequently if
    the action of cold at the surface in polar regions is equivalent to
    that of heat, the cold must contract the molecules at the surface and
    make them sink <em>through</em> the mass of polar water beneath. But assuming
    this to be the meaning in the passage just quoted, how much colder is
    the surface water than the water beneath? Let us suppose the difference
    to be one degree. How much work, then, will gravity perform upon this
    one pound of water which is one degree colder than the mass beneath
    supposed to be at 32°? The force with which the pound of water will
    sink will not be proportional to its weight, but to the difference
    of weight between it and a similar bulk of the water through which
    it sinks. The difference between the weight of a pound of water at
    31° and an equal volume of water at 32° is 1/29,000th of a pound. Now
    this pound of water in sinking to a depth of 10,000 feet, which is
    about the depth at which a polar temperature is found at the equator,
    would perform only one-third of a foot-pound of work. And supposing
    it were three degrees colder than the water beneath, it would in
    sinking perform only one foot-pound. This would give us only 4 + 1 = 5
    foot-pounds as the total amount that could be performed by gravitation
    on the pound of water from the time that it left the equator till
    it returned to the point from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> it started. The amount of work
    performed in descending the slope from the equator to the pole and in
    sinking to a depth of 10,000 feet or so through the polar water assumed
    to be warmer than the surface water, comprehends the total amount of
    work that gravitation can possibly perform; so that the amount of force
    gained by such a supposition over and above that derived from the slope
    is trifling.</p>

  <p>It would appear, however, that this is not what is meant after all.
    What Dr. Carpenter apparently means is this: when a quantity of water,
    say a layer one foot thick, flows down from the equator to the pole,
    the polar column becomes then heavier than the equatorial by the
    weight of this additional layer. A layer of water equal in quantity
    is therefore pressed away from the bottom of the column and flows off
    in the direction of the equator as an under current, the polar column
    at the same time sinking down one foot until equilibrium of the polar
    and equatorial columns is restored. Another foot of water now flows
    down upon the polar column and another foot of water is displaced
    from below, causing, of course, the column to descend an additional
    foot. The same process being continually repeated, a constant downward
    motion of the polar column is the result. Or, perhaps, to express the
    matter more accurately, owing to the constant flow of water from the
    equatorial regions down the slope, the weight of the polar column is
    kept always in excess of that of the equatorial; therefore the polar
    column in the effort to restore equilibrium is kept in a constant state
    of descent. Hence he terms it a “vertical” circulation. The following
    will show Dr. Carpenter’s theory in his own words:—</p>

  <p>“The action of cold on the surface water of each polar area will be
    exerted as follows:—</p>

  <p>“(<i>a</i>) In diminishing the height of the polar column as compared with
    that of the equatorial, so that a lowering of its <em>level</em> is produced,
    which can only be made good by a surface-flow from the latter towards
    the former.</p>

  <p>“(<i>b</i>) In producing an excess in the downward <em>pressure</em> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> column
    when this inflow has restored its level, in virtue of the increase of
    specific gravity it has gained by its reduction in volume; whereby a
    portion of its heavy bottom-water is displaced laterally, causing a
    further reduction of level, which draws in a further supply of the
    warmer and lighter water flowing towards its surface.</p>

  <p>“(<i>c</i>) In imparting a downward <em>movement</em> to each new surface-stratum
    as its temperature undergoes reduction; so that the <em>entire column</em> may
    be said to be in a state of constant descent, like that which exists in
    the water of a tall jar when an opening is made at its bottom, and the
    water which flows away through it is replaced by an equivalent supply
    poured into the top of the jar” (§ 23).</p>

  <p>But if this be his theory, as it evidently is, then the 4 foot-pounds
    (the amount of work performed by the descent of the water down the
    slope) comprehends all the work that gravitation can perform on a pound
    of water in making a complete circuit from the equator to the pole and
    from the pole back to the equator.</p>

  <p>This, I trust, will be evident from the following considerations. When
    a pound of water has flowed down from the equator to the pole, it has
    descended 4 feet, and is then at the foot of the slope. Gravity has
    therefore no more power to pull it down to a lower level. It will not
    sink through the polar water, for it is not denser than the water
    beneath on which it rests. But it may be replied that although it will
    not sink through the polar water, it has nevertheless made the polar
    column heavier than the equatorial, and this excess of pressure forces
    a pound of water out from beneath and allows the column to descend.
    Suppose it may be argued that a quantity of water flows down from the
    equator, so as to raise the level of the polar water by, say, one foot.
    The polar column will now be rendered heavier than the equatorial by
    the weight of one foot of water. The pressure of the one foot will
    thus force a quantity of water laterally from the bottom and cause the
    entire column to descend till the level of equilibrium is restored. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>In
    other words, the polar column will sink one foot. Now in the sinking of
    this column work is performed by gravity. A certain amount of work is
    performed by gravity in causing the water to flow down the slope from
    the equator to the pole, and, in addition to this, a certain amount is
    performed by gravity in the vertical descent of the column.</p>

  <p>I freely admit this to be sound reasoning, and admit that so much is
    due to the slope and so much to the vertical descent of the water. But
    here we come to the most important point, viz., is there the full slope
    of 4 feet and an additional vertical movement? Dr. Carpenter seems
    to conclude that there is, and that this vertical force is something
    in addition to the force which I derive from the slope. And here, I
    venture to think, is a radical error into which he has fallen in regard
    to the whole matter. Let it be observed that, when water circulates
    from difference of specific gravity, this vertical movement is just as
    real a part of the process as the flow down the slope; but the point
    which I maintain is that <em>there is no additional power derived from
    this vertical movement over and above what is derived from the full
    slope</em>—or, in other words, that this <i lang="la">primum mobile</i>, which he says I
    have overlooked, has in reality no existence.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the following diagram will help to make the point still
    clearer:—</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_155" >
    <div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div>
    <img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="600" height="233" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Let P (fig. 1) be the surface of the ocean at the pole, and E the
    surface at the equator; P O a column of water at the pole, and E Q a
    column at the equator. The two columns are of equal weight, and balance
    each other; but as the polar water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> is colder, and consequently denser
    than the equatorial, the polar column is shorter than the equatorial,
    the difference in the length of the two columns being 4 feet. The
    surface of the ocean at the equator E is 4 feet higher than the surface
    of the ocean at the pole P; there is therefore a slope of 4 feet from E
    to P. The molecules of water at E tend to flow down this slope towards
    P. The amount of work performed by gravity in the descent of a pound of
    water down this slope from E to P is therefore 4 foot-pounds.</p>

  <p>But of course there can be no permanent circulation while the full
    slope remains. In order to have circulation the polar column must be
    heavier than the equatorial. But any addition to the weight of the
    polar column is at the expense of the slope. In proportion as the
    weight of the polar column increases the less becomes the slope. This,
    however, makes no difference in the amount of work performed by gravity.</p>

  <p>Suppose now that water has flowed down till an addition of one foot
    of water is made to the polar column, and the difference of level,
    of course, diminished by one foot. The surface of the ocean in this
    case will now be represented by the dotted line P′ E, and the slope
    reduced from 4 feet to 3 feet. Let us then suppose a pound of water to
    leave E and flow down to P′; 3 foot-pounds will be the amount of work
    performed. The polar column being now too heavy by the extent of the
    mass of water P′ P one foot thick, its extra pressure causes a mass of
    water equal to P′ P to flow off laterally from the bottom of the column.
    The column therefore sinks down one foot till P′ reaches P. Now the
    pound of water in this vertical descent from P′ to P has one foot-pound
    of work performed on it by gravity; this added to the 3 foot-pounds
    derived from the slope, gives a total of 4 foot-pounds in passing from
    E to P′ and then from P′ to P. This is the same amount of work that
    would have been performed had it descended directly from E to P. In
    like manner it can be proved that 4 foot-pounds is the amount of work
    performed in the descent of every pound of water of the mass P′ P. The
    first pound which left E flowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> down the slope directly to P, and
    performed 4 foot-pounds of work. The last pound flowed down the slope E
    P′, and performed only 3 foot-pounds; but in descending from P′ to P it
    performed the other one foot-pound. A pound leaving at a period exactly
    intermediate between the two flowed down 3½ feet of slope and descended
    vertically half a foot. Whatever path a pound of water might take, by
    the time that it reached P, 4 foot-pounds of work would be performed.
    But no further work can be performed after it reaches P.</p>

  <p>But some will ask, in regard to the vertical movement, is it only in
    the descent of the water from P′ to P that work is performed? Water
    cannot descend from P′ to P, it will be urged, unless the entire column
    P O underneath descend also. But the column P O descends by means of
    gravity. Why, then, it will be asked, is not the descent of the column
    a motive power as real as the descent of the mass of water P′ P?</p>

  <p>That neither force nor energy can be derived from the mere descent of
    the polar column P O is demonstrable thus:—The reason why the column P
    O descends is because, in consequence of the mass of water P′ P resting
    on it, its weight is in excess of the equatorial column E Q. But the
    force with which the column descends is equal, not to the weight of
    the column, but to the weight of the mass P′ P; consequently as much
    work would be performed by gravity in the descent of the mass P′ P (the
    one foot of water) alone as in the descent of the entire column P′ O,
    10,000 feet in height. Suppose a ton weight is placed in each scale of
    a balance: the two scales balance each other. Place a pound weight in
    one of the scales along with the ton weight and the scale will descend.
    But it descends, not with the pressure of a ton and a pound, but with
    the pressure of the pound weight only. In the descent of the scale,
    say, one foot, gravity can perform only one foot-pound of work. In like
    manner, in the descent of the polar column, the only work available is
    the work of the mass P′ P laid on the top of the column. But it must be
    observed that in the descent of the column from P′ to P, a distance of
    one foot, each pound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> water of the mass P′ P does not perform one
    foot-pound of work; for the moment that a molecule of water reaches P,
    it then ceases to perform further work. The molecules at the surface P′
    descend one foot before reaching P; the molecules midway between P′ and
    P descend only half a foot before reaching P, and the molecules at the
    bottom of the mass are already at P, and therefore cannot perform any
    work. The mean distance through which the entire mass performs work is
    therefore half a foot. One foot-pound per pound of water represents in
    this case the amount of work derived from the vertical movement.</p>

  <p>That such is the case is further evident from the following
    considerations. Before the polar column begins to descend, it is
    heavier than the equatorial by the weight of one foot of water; but
    when the column has descended half a foot, the polar column is heavier
    than the equatorial by the weight of only half a foot of water; and,
    as the column continues to descend, the force with which it descends
    continues to diminish, and when it has sunk to P the force is zero.
    Consequently the mean pressure or weight with which the one foot of
    water P′ P descended was equal to that of a layer of half a foot of
    water; in other words, each pound of water, taking the mass as a whole,
    descended with the pressure or weight of half a pound. But a half
    pound descending one foot performs half a foot-pound; so that whether
    we consider the <em>full pressure acting through the mean distance, or
    the mean pressure acting through the full distance, we get the same
    result</em>, viz. a half foot-pound as the work of vertical descent.</p>

  <p>Now it will be found, as we shall presently see, that if we calculate
    the mean amount of work performed in descending the slope from the
    equator to the pole, 3½ foot-pounds per pound of water is the amount.
    The water at the bottom of the mass P P′ moved, of course, down the
    full slope E P 4 feet. The water at the top of the mass which descended
    from E to P′ descended a slope of only 3 feet. The mean descent of the
    whole mass is therefore 3½ feet. And this gives 3½ foot-pounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> as the
    mean amount of work per pound of water in descending the slope; this,
    added to the half foot-pound derived from vertical descent, gives 4
    foot-pounds as the total amount of work per pound of the mass.</p>

  <p>I have in the above reasoning supposed one foot of water accumulated
    on the polar column before any vertical descent takes place. It is
    needless to remark that the same conclusion would have been arrived
    at, viz., that the total amount of work performed is 4 foot-pounds per
    pound of water, supposing we had considered 2 feet, or 3 feet, or even
    4 feet of water to have accumulated on the polar column before vertical
    motion took place.</p>

  <p>I have also, in agreement with Dr. Carpenter’s mode of representing
    the operation, been considering the two effects, viz., the flowing of
    the water down the slope and the vertical descent of the polar column
    as taking place alternately. In nature, however, the two effects take
    place simultaneously; but it is needless to add that the amount of work
    performed would be the same whether the effects took place alternately
    or simultaneously.</p>

  <p>I have also represented the level of the ocean at the equator as
    remaining permanent while the alterations of level were taking place at
    the pole. But in representing the operation as it would actually take
    place in nature, we should consider the equatorial column to be lowered
    as the polar one is being raised. We should, for example, consider the
    one foot of water P′ P put upon the polar column as so much taken off
    the equatorial column. But in viewing the problem thus we arrive at
    exactly the same results as before.</p>

  <p>Let P (Fig. 2), as in Fig. 1, be the surface of the ocean at the pole,
    and E the surface at the equator, there being a slope of 4 feet from E
    to P. Suppose now a quantity of water, E E′, say, one foot thick, to
    flow from off the equatorial regions down upon the polar. It will thus
    lower the level of the equatorial column by one foot, and raise the
    level of the polar column by the same amount. I may, however, observe
    that the one foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> of water in passing from E to P would have its
    temperature reduced from 80° to 32°, and this would produce a slight
    contraction. But as the weight of the mass would not be affected, in
    order to simplify our reasoning we may leave this contraction out of
    consideration. Any one can easily satisfy himself that the assumption
    that E E′ is equal to P′ P does not in any way affect the question at
    issue—the only effect of the contraction being to <em>increase</em> by an
    infinitesimal amount the work done in descending the slope, and to
    <em>diminish</em> by an equally infinitesimal amount the work done in the
    vertical descent. If, for example, 3 foot-pounds represent the amount
    of work performed in descending the slope, and one foot-pound the
    amount performed in the vertical descent, on the supposition that E′ E
    does not contract in passing to the pole, then 3·0024 foot-pounds will
    represent the work of the slope, and 0·9976 foot-pounds the work of
    vertical descent when allowance is made for the contraction. But the
    total amount of work performed is the same in both cases. Consequently,
    to simplify our reasoning, we may be allowed to assume P′ P to be equal
    to E E′.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_160" >
    <div class="caption">Fig. 2.</div>
    <img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="600" height="234" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The slope E P being 4 feet, the slope E′ P′ is consequently 2 feet;
    the mean slope for the entire mass is therefore 3 feet. The mean
    amount of work performed by the descent of the mass will of course
    be 3 foot-pounds per pound of water. The amount of work performed by
    the vertical descent of P′ P ought therefore to be one foot-pound per
    pound. That this is the amount will be evident thus:—The transference
    of the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> foot of water from the equatorial column to the polar
    disturbs the equilibrium by making the equatorial column too light by
    one foot of water and the polar column too heavy by the same amount of
    water. The polar column will therefore tend to sink, and the equatorial
    to rise till equilibrium is restored. The difference of weight of
    the two columns being equal to 2 feet of water, the polar column
    will begin to descend with a pressure of 2 feet of water; and the
    equatorial column will begin to rise with an equal amount of pressure.
    When the polar column has descended half a foot the equatorial column
    will have risen half a foot. The pressure of the descending polar
    column will now be reduced to one foot of water. And when the polar
    column has descended another foot, P′ will have reached P, and E′
    will have reached E; the two columns will then be in equilibrium. It
    therefore follows that the mean pressure with which the polar column
    descended the one foot was equal to the pressure of one foot of water.
    Consequently the mean amount of work performed by the descent of the
    mass was equal to one foot-pound per pound of water; this, added to the
    3 foot-pounds derived from the slope, gives a total of 4 foot-pounds.</p>

  <p>In whatever way we view the question, we are led to the conclusion that
    if 4 feet represent the amount of slope between the equatorial and
    polar columns when the two are in equilibrium, then 4 foot-pounds is
    the total amount of work that gravity can perform upon a pound of water
    in overcoming the resistance to motion in its passage from the equator
    to the pole down the slope, and then in its vertical descent to the
    bottom of the ocean.</p>

  <p>But it will be replied, not only does the one foot of water P′ P
    descend, but the entire column P O, 10,000 feet in length, descends
    also. What, then, it will be asked, becomes of the force which gravity
    exerts in the descent of this column? We shall shortly see that this
    force is entirely applied in work against gravity in other parts of
    the circuit; so that not a single foot-pound of this force goes to
    overcome cohesion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> friction, and other resistances; it is all spent in
    counteracting the efforts which gravity exerts to stop the current in
    another part of the circuit.</p>

  <p>I shall now consider the next part of the movement, viz., the under
    or return current from the bottom of the polar to the bottom of the
    equatorial column. What produces this current? It is needless to say
    that it cannot be caused directly by gravity. Gravitation cannot
    directly draw any body horizontally along the earth’s surface. The
    water that forms this current is pressed out laterally by the weight
    of the polar column, and flows, or rather is pushed, towards the
    equator to supply the vacancy caused by the ascent of the equatorial
    column. There is a constant flow of water from the equator to the poles
    along the surface, and this draining of the water from the equator is
    supplied by the under or return current from the poles. But the only
    power which can impel the water from the bottom of the polar column
    to the bottom of the equatorial column is the pressure of the polar
    column. But whence does the polar column derive its pressure? It can
    only press to the extent that its weight exceeds that of the equatorial
    column. That which exerts the pressure is therefore the mass of water
    which has flowed down the slope from the equator upon the polar column.
    It is in this case the vertical movement that causes this under
    current. The energy which produces this current must consequently be
    derived from the 4 foot-pounds resulting from the slope; for the energy
    of the vertical movement, as has already been proved, is derived from
    this source; or, in other words, whatever power this vertical movement
    may exert is so much deducted from the 4 foot-pounds derived from the
    full slope.</p>

  <p>Let us now consider the fourth and last movement, viz., the ascent of
    the under current to the surface of the ocean at the equator. When
    this cold under current reaches the equatorial regions, it ascends
    to the surface to the point whence it originally started on its
    circuit. What, then, lifts the water from the bottom of the equatorial
    column to its top? This cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> be done directly, either by heat or
    by gravity. When heat, for example, is applied to the bottom of a
    vessel, the heated water at the bottom expands and, becoming lighter
    than the water above, rises through it to the surface; but if the
    heat be applied to the surface of the water instead of to the bottom,
    the heat will not produce an ascending current. It will tend rather
    to prevent such a current than to produce one—the reason being that
    each successive layer of water will, on account of the heat applied,
    become hotter and consequently lighter than the layer below it, and
    colder and consequently heavier than the layer above it. It therefore
    cannot ascend, because it is too heavy; nor can it descend, because
    it is too light. But the sea in equatorial regions is heated from
    above, and not from below; consequently the water at the bottom does
    not rise to the surface at the equator in virtue of any heat which it
    receives. A layer of water can never raise the temperature of a layer
    below it to a higher temperature than itself; and since it cannot do
    this, it cannot make the layer under it lighter than itself. That which
    raises the water at the equator, according to Dr. Carpenter’s theory,
    must be the downward pressure of the polar column. When water flows
    down the slope from the equator to the pole, the polar column, as we
    have seen, becomes too heavy and the equatorial column too light;
    the former then sinks and the latter rises. It is the sinking of the
    polar column which raises the equatorial one. When the polar column
    descends, as much water is pressed in underneath the equatorial column
    as is pressed from underneath the polar column. If one foot of water
    is pressed from under the polar column, a foot of water is pressed in
    under the equatorial column. Thus, when the polar column sinks a foot,
    the equatorial column rises to the same extent. The equatorial water
    continuing to flow down the slope, the polar column descends: a foot
    of water is again pressed from underneath the polar column and a foot
    pressed in under the equatorial. As foot after foot is thus removed
    from the bottom of the polar column while it sinks, foot after foot is
    pushed in under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> the equatorial column while it rises; so by this means
    the water at the surface of the ocean in polar regions descends to
    the bottom, and the water at the bottom in equatorial regions ascends
    to the surface—the effect of solar heat and polar cold continuing, of
    course, to maintain the surface of the ocean in equatorial regions at a
    higher level than at the poles, and thus keeping up a constant state of
    disturbed equilibrium. Or, to state the matter in Dr. Carpenter’s own
    words, “The cold and dense polar water, as it flows in at the bottom of
    the equatorial column, will not directly take the place of that which
    has been drafted off from the surface; but this place will be filled
    by the rising of the whole superincumbent column, which, being warmer,
    is also lighter than the cold stratum beneath. Every new arrival from
    the poles will take its place below that which precedes it, since its
    temperature will have been less affected by contact with the warmer
    water above it. In this way an ascending movement will be imparted to
    the whole equatorial column, and in due course every portion of it will
    come under the influence of the surface-heat of the sun.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

  <p>But the agency which raises up the water of the under current to the
    surface is the pressure of the polar column. The equatorial column
    cannot rise directly by means of gravity. Gravity, instead of raising
    the column, exerts all its powers to prevent its rising. Gravity
    here is a force acting against the current. It is the descent of
    the polar column, as has been stated, that raises the equatorial
    column. Consequently the entire amount of work performed by gravity
    in pulling down the polar column is spent in raising the equatorial
    column. Gravity performs exactly as much work in preventing motion
    in the equatorial column as it performs in producing motion in the
    polar column; so that, so far as the vertical parts of Dr. Carpenter’s
    circulation are concerned, gravity may be said neither to produce
    motion nor to prevent it. And this remark, be it observed, applies not
    only to P O and E Q, but also to the parts P′ P and E E′ of the two
    columns. When a mass of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>water E E′, say one foot deep, is removed off
    the equatorial column and placed upon the polar column, the latter
    column is then heavier than the former by the weight of two feet of
    water. Gravity then exerts more force in pulling the polar column down
    than it does in preventing the equatorial column from rising; and
    the consequence is that the polar column begins to descend and the
    equatorial column to rise. But as the polar column continues to descend
    and the equatorial to rise, the power of gravity to produce motion in
    the polar column diminishes, and the power of gravity to prevent motion
    in the equatorial column increases; and when P′ descends to P and E′
    rises to E, the power of gravity to prevent motion in the equatorial
    column is exactly equal to the power of gravity to produce motion in
    the polar column, and consequently motion ceases. It therefore follows
    that the entire amount of work performed by the descent of P′ P is
    spent in raising E′ E against gravity.</p>

  <p>It follows also that inequalities in the sea-bottom cannot in any
    way aid the circulation; for although the cold under current should
    in its progress come to a deep trough filled with water less dense
    than itself, it would no doubt sink to the bottom of the hollow; yet
    before it could get out again as much work would have to be performed
    against gravity as was performed by gravity in sinking it. But whilst
    inequalities in the bed of the ocean would not aid the current, they
    would nevertheless very considerably retard it by the obstructions
    which they would offer to the motion of the water.</p>

  <p>We have been assuming that the weight of P′ P is equal to that of E E′;
    but the mass P′ P must be greater than E E′ because P′ P has not only
    to raise E E′, but to impel the under current—to push the water along
    the sea-bottom from the pole to the equator. So we must have a mass of
    water, in addition to P′ P, placed on the polar column to enable it to
    produce the under current in addition to the raising of the equatorial
    column.</p>

  <p>It follows also that the amount of work which can be performed by
    gravity depends entirely on the <em>difference</em> of temperature <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>between
    the equatorial and the polar waters, and is wholly independent of the
    way in which the temperature may decrease from the equator to the
    poles. Suppose, in agreement with Dr. Carpenter’s idea,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that the
    equatorial heat and polar cold should be confined to limited areas, and
    that through the intermediate space no great difference of temperature
    should prevail. Such an arrangement as this would not increase the
    amount of work which gravity could perform; it would simply make the
    slope steeper at the two extremes and flatter in the intervening space.
    It would no doubt aid the surface-flow of the water near the equator
    and the poles, but it would retard in a corresponding degree the flow
    of the water in the intermediate regions. In short, it would merely
    destroy the uniformity of the slope without aiding in the least degree
    the general motion of the water.</p>

  <p>It is therefore demonstrable that <em>the energy derived from the full
    slope, whatever that slope may be, comprehends all that can possibly be
    obtained from gravity</em>.</p>

  <p>It cannot be urged as an objection to what has been advanced that I
    have determined simply the amount of the force acting on the water at
    the surface of the ocean and not that on the water at all depths—that I
    have estimated the amount of work which gravity can perform on a given
    quantity of water at the surface, but not the total amount of work
    which gravity can perform on the entire ocean. This objection will not
    stand, because it is at the surface of the ocean where the greatest
    difference of temperature, and consequently of density, exists between
    the equatorial and polar waters, and therefore there that gravity
    exerts its greatest force. And if gravity be unable to move the water
    at the surface, it is much less able to do so under the surface. So
    far as the question at issue is concerned, any calculations as to the
    amount of force exerted by gravity at various depths are needless.</p>

  <p>It is maintained also that the winds cannot produce a vertical current
    except under some very peculiar conditions. We have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>already seen that,
    according to Dr. Carpenter’s theory, the vertical motion is caused
    by the water flowing off the equatorial column, down the slope, upon
    the polar column, thus destroying the equilibrium between the two by
    diminishing the weight of the equatorial column and increasing that of
    the polar column. In order that equilibrium may be restored, the polar
    column sinks and the equatorial one rises. Now must not the same effect
    occur, supposing the water to be transferred from the one column to
    the other, by the influence of the winds instead of by the influence
    of gravity? The vertical descent and ascent of these columns depend
    entirely upon the difference in their weights, and not upon the nature
    of the agency which makes this difference. So far as difference of
    weight is concerned, 2 feet of water, propelled down the slope from the
    equatorial column to the polar by the winds, will produce just the same
    effect as though it had been propelled by gravity. If vertical motion
    follows as a necessary consequence from a transference of water from
    the equator to the poles by gravity, it follows equally as a necessary
    consequence from the same transference by the winds; so that one is not
    at liberty to advocate a vertical circulation in the one case and to
    deny it in the other.</p>

  <p><em>Gravitation Theory of the Gibraltar Current.</em>—If difference of
    specific gravity fails to account for the currents of the ocean in
    general, it certainly fails in a still more decided manner to account
    for the Gibraltar current. The existence of the submarine ridge
    between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel, as was shown in the Phil. Mag.
    for October, 1871, p. 269, affects currents resulting from difference
    of specific gravity in a manner which does not seem to have suggested
    itself to Dr. Carpenter. The pressure of water and other fluids is
    not like that of a solid—not like that of the weight in the scale of
    a balance, simply a downward pressure. Fluids press downwards like
    the solids, but they also press laterally. The pressure of water is
    hydrostatic. If we fill a basin with water or any other fluid, the
    fluid remains in perfect equilibrium, provided the sides of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> basin
    be sufficiently strong to resist the pressure. The Mediterranean and
    Atlantic, up to the level of the submarine ridge referred to, may be
    regarded as huge basins, the sides of which are sufficiently strong to
    resist all pressure. It follows that, however much denser the water
    of the Mediterranean may be than that of the Atlantic, it is only the
    water above the level of the ridge that can possibly exercise any
    influence in the way of disturbing equilibrium, so as to cause the
    level of the Mediterranean to stand lower than that of the Atlantic.
    The water of the Atlantic below the level of this ridge might be as
    light as air, and that of the Mediterranean as heavy as molten lead,
    but this could produce no disturbance of equilibrium; and if there be
    no difference of density between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean
    waters from the surface down to the level of the top of the ridge, then
    there can be nothing to produce the circulation which Dr. Carpenter
    infers. Suppose both basins empty, and dense water to be poured into
    the Mediterranean, and water less dense into the Atlantic, until they
    are both filled up to the level of the ridge, it is evident that the
    heavier water in the one basin can exercise no influence in raising
    the level of the lighter water in the other basin, the entire pressure
    being borne by the sides of the basins. But if we continue to pour in
    water till the surface is raised, say one foot, above the level of the
    ridge, then there is nothing to resist the lateral pressure of this one
    foot of water in the Mediterranean but the counter pressure of the one
    foot in the Atlantic. But as the Mediterranean water is denser than the
    Atlantic, this one foot of water will consequently exert more pressure
    than the one foot of water of the Atlantic. We must therefore continue
    to pour more water into the Atlantic until its lateral pressure equals
    that of the Mediterranean. The two seas will then be in equilibrium,
    but the surface of the Atlantic will of course be at a higher level
    than the surface of the Mediterranean. The difference of level will be
    proportionate to the difference in density of the waters of the two
    seas. But here we come to the point of importance. In determining the
    difference of level between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> the two seas, or, which is the same thing,
    the difference of level between a column of the Atlantic and a column
    of the Mediterranean, we must take into consideration <em>only the water
    which lies above the level of the ridge</em>. If there be one foot of water
    above the ridge, then there is a difference of level proportionate to
    the difference of pressure between the one foot of water of the two
    seas. If there be 2 feet, 3 feet, or any number of feet of water above
    the level of the ridge, the difference of level is proportionate to
    the 2 feet, 3 feet, or whatever number of feet there may be of water
    above the ridge. If, for example, 13 should represent the density of
    the Mediterranean water and 12 the density of the Atlantic water, then
    if there were one foot of water in the Mediterranean above the level of
    the ridge, there would require to be one foot one inch of water in the
    Atlantic above the ridge in order that the two might be in equilibrium.
    The difference of level would therefore be one inch. If there were 2
    feet of water, the difference of level would be 2 inches; if 3 feet,
    the difference would be 3 inches, and so on. And this would follow,
    no matter what the actual depth of the two basins might be; the water
    below the level of the ridge exercising no influence whatever on the
    level of the surface.</p>

  <p>Taking Dr. Carpenter’s own data as to the density of the Mediterranean
    and Atlantic waters, what, then, is the difference of density? The
    submarine ridge comes to within 167 fathoms of the surface; say, in
    round numbers, to within 1,000 feet. What are the densities of the two
    basins down to the depth of 1,000 feet? According to Dr. Carpenter
    there is little, if any, difference. His own words on this point are
    these:—“A comparison of these results leaves no doubt that there is
    an excess of salinity in the water of the Mediterranean above that of
    the Atlantic; but that this excess <em>is</em> slight in the surface-water,
    whilst somewhat greater in the deeper water” (§ 7). “Again, it was
    found by examining samples of water taken from the surface, from 100
    fathoms, from 250 fathoms, and from 400 fathoms respectively, that
    whilst the <em>first two</em> had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> <em>characteristic temperature and density
    of Atlantic water</em>, the last two had the characteristics and density of
    Mediterranean water” (§ 13). Here, at least to the depth of 100 fathoms
    or 600 feet, there is little difference of density between the waters
    of the two basins. Consequently down to the depth of 600 feet, there is
    nothing to produce any sensible disturbance of equilibrium. If there
    be any sensible disturbance of equilibrium, it must be in consequence
    of difference of density which may exist between the depths of 600
    feet and the surface of the ridge. We have nothing to do with any
    difference which may exist between the water of the Mediterranean and
    the Atlantic below the ridge; the water in the Mediterranean basin may
    be as heavy as mercury below 1,000 feet: but this can have no effect
    in disturbing equilibrium. The water to the depth of 600 feet being of
    the same density in both seas, the length of the two columns acting on
    each other is therefore reduced to 400 feet—that is, to that stratum of
    water lying at a depth of from 600 to the surface of the ridge 1,000
    feet below the surface. But, to give the theory full justice, we shall
    take the Mediterranean stratum at the density of the deep water of
    the Mediterranean, which he found to be about 1·029, and the density
    of the Atlantic stratum at 1·026. The difference of density between
    the two columns is therefore ·003. Consequently, if the height of the
    Mediterranean column be 400 feet, it will be balanced by the Atlantic
    column of 401·2 feet; the difference of level between the Mediterranean
    and the Atlantic cannot therefore be more than 1·2 foot. The amount
    of work that can be performed by gravity in the case of the Gibraltar
    current is little more than one foot-pound per pound of water, an
    amount of energy evidently inadequate to produce the current.</p>

  <p>It is true that in his last expedition Dr. Carpenter found the
    bottom-water on the ridge somewhat denser than Atlantic water at the
    same depth, the former being 1·0292 and the latter 1·0265; but it
    also proved to be denser than Mediterranean water at the same depth.
    He found, for example, that “the dense Mediterranean water lies about
    100 fathoms nearer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> surface over a 300-fathoms bottom, than it
    does where the bottom sinks to more than 500 fathoms” (§ 51). But any
    excess of density which might exist at the ridge could have no tendency
    whatever to make the Mediterranean column preponderate over the
    Atlantic column, any more than could a weight placed over the fulcrum
    of a balance have a tendency to make the one scale weigh down the other.</p>

  <p>If the objection referred to be sound, it shows the mechanical
    impossibility of the theory. It proves that whether there be an under
    current or not, or whether the dense water lying in the deep trough of
    the Mediterranean be carried over the submarine ridge into the Atlantic
    or not, the explanation offered by Dr. Carpenter is one which cannot be
    admitted. It is incumbent on him to explain either (1) how the almost
    infinitesimal difference of density which exists between the Atlantic
    and Mediterranean columns down to the level of the ridge can produce
    the upper and under currents carrying the deep and dense water of
    the Mediterranean over the ridge, or (2) how all this can be done by
    means of the difference of density which exists below the level of the
    ridge.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> What the true cause of the Gibraltar current really is will
    be considered in Chap. XIII.</p>

  <p><em>The Baltic Current.</em>—The entrance to the Baltic Sea is in some
    places not over 50 or 60 feet deep. It follows, therefore, from what
    has already been proved in regard to the Gibraltar current, that the
    influence of gravity must be even still less in causing a current in
    the Baltic strait than in the Gibraltar strait.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the foregoing chapter, the substance of which appeared in the
    Phil. Mag. for October, 1871, I have represented the manner in which
    difference of specific gravity produces circulation. But Dr. Carpenter
    appears to think that there are some important points which I have
    overlooked. These I shall now proceed to consider in detail.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Croll’s whole manner of treating the subject,” he says, “is so
    different from that which it appears to me to require, and he has so
    completely misapprehended my own view of the question, that I feel it
    requisite to present this in fuller detail in order that physicists and
    mathematicians, having both sides fully before them, may judge between
    us” (§ 26).<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

  <p>He then refers to a point so obvious as hardly to require
    consideration, viz., the effect which results when the surface of
    the entire area of a lake or pond of water is cooled. The whole of
    the surface-film, being chilled at the same time, sinks through the
    subjacent water, and a new film from the warmer layer immediately
    beneath the surface rises into its place. This being cooled in its
    turn, sinks, and so on. He next considers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>what takes place when only
    a portion of the surface of the pond is cooled, and shows that in this
    case the surface-film which descends is replaced not from beneath, but
    by an inflow from the neighbouring area.</p>

  <p>“That such must be the case,” says Dr. Carpenter, “appears to me so
    self-evident that I am surprised that any person conversant with the
    principles of physical science should hesitate in admitting it, still
    more that he should explicitly deny it. But since others may feel the
    same difficulty as Mr. Croll, it may be worth while for me to present
    the case in a form of yet more elementary simplicity” (§ 29).</p>

  <p>Then, in order to show the mode in which the general oceanic
    circulation takes place, he supposes two cylindrical vessels, W and
    C, of equal size, to be filled with sea-water. Cylinder W represents
    the equatorial column, and the water contained in it has its
    temperature maintained at 60°; whilst the water in the other cylinder
    C, representing the polar column, has its temperature maintained at
    30° by means of the constant application of cold at the top. Free
    communication is maintained between the two cylinders at top and
    bottom; and the water in the cold cylinder being, in virtue of its
    low temperature, denser than the water in the warm cylinder, the two
    columns are therefore not in static equilibrium. The cold, and hence
    heavier column tends to produce an outflow of water from its bottom to
    the bottom of the warm column, which outflow is replaced by an inflow
    from the top of the warm column to the top of the cold column. In fact,
    we have just a simple repetition of what he has given over and over
    again in his various memoirs on the subject. But why so repeatedly
    enter into the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> of the matter? Who feels any difficulty
    in understanding how the circulation is produced?</p>

  <p><em>Polar Cold considered by Dr. Carpenter the Primum Mobile.</em>—It is
    evident that Dr. Carpenter believes that he has found in polar <em>cold</em>
    an agency the potency of which, in producing a general oceanic
    circulation, has been overlooked by physicists; and it is with the view
    of developing his ideas on this subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> that he has entered so fully
    and so frequently into the exposition of his theory. “If I have myself
    done anything,” he says, “to strengthen the doctrine, it has been by
    showing that polar cold, rather than equatorial heat, is the <i lang="la">primum
    mobile</i> of this circulation.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

  <p>The influence of the sun in heating the waters of the inter-tropical
    seas is, in Dr. Carpenter’s manner of viewing the problem, of no
    great importance. The efficient cause of motion he considers resides
    in <em>cold</em> rather than in <em>heat</em>. In fact, he even goes the length
    of maintaining that, as a power in the production of the general
    interchange of equatorial and polar water, the effect of polar cold is
    so much superior to that of inter-tropical heat, that the influence of
    the latter may be <em>practically disregarded</em>.</p>

  <p>“Suppose two basins of ocean-water,” he says, “connected by a strait to
    be placed under such different climatic conditions that the surface of
    one is exposed to the heating influence of tropical sunshine, whilst
    the surface of the other is subjected to the extreme cold of the
    sunless polar winter. The effect of the surface-heat upon the water
    of the tropical basin will be for the most part limited (as I shall
    presently show) to its uppermost stratum, and may here be <em>practically
    disregarded</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Carpenter’s idea regarding the efficiency of cold in producing
    motion seems to me to be not only opposed to the generally received
    views on the subject, but wholly irreconcilable with the ordinary
    principles of mechanics. In fact, there are so many points on which
    Dr. Carpenter’s theory of a “General <em>Vertical</em> Oceanic Circulation”
    differs from the generally received views on the subject of circulation
    by means of difference of specific gravity, that I have thought it
    advisable to enter somewhat minutely into the consideration of the
    mechanics of that theory, the more so as he has so repeatedly asserted
    that eminent physicists agree with what he has advanced on the subject.</p>

  <p>According to the generally received theory, the circulation <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>is due to
    the <em>difference of density</em> between the sea in equatorial and polar
    regions. The real efficient cause is gravity; but gravity cannot act
    when there is no difference of specific gravity. If the sea were of
    equal density from the poles to the equator, gravity could exercise no
    influence in the production of circulation; and the influence which it
    does possess is in proportion to the difference of density. But the
    difference of density between equatorial and polar waters is in turn
    due not absolutely either to polar cold or to tropical heat, but to
    both—or, in other words, to the <em>difference</em> of temperature between
    the polar and equatorial seas. This difference, in the very nature of
    things, must be as much the result of equatorial heat as of polar cold.
    If the sea in equatorial regions were not being heated by the sun as
    rapidly as the sea in polar regions is being cooled, the difference of
    temperature between them, and consequently the difference of density,
    would be diminishing, and in course of time would disappear altogether.
    As has already been shown, it is a necessary consequence that the
    water flowing from equatorial to polar regions must be compensated by
    an equal amount flowing from polar to equatorial regions. Now, if the
    water flowing from polar to equatorial regions were not being heated
    as rapidly as the water flowing from equatorial to polar regions is
    being cooled, the equatorial seas would gradually become colder and
    colder until no sensible difference of temperature existed between
    them and the polar oceans. In fact, <em>equality of the two rates</em> is
    necessary to the very existence of such a general circulation as that
    advocated by Dr. Carpenter. If he admits that the general interchange
    of equatorial and polar water advocated by him is caused by the
    difference of density between the water at the equator and the poles,
    resulting from difference of temperature, then he must admit also that
    this difference of density is just as much due to the heating of the
    equatorial water by the sun as it is to the cooling of the polar water
    by radiation and other means—or, in other words, that it is as much due
    to equatorial heat as to polar cold. And if so, it cannot be true that
    polar cold rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> than equatorial heat is the “<i lang="la">primum mobile</i>” of
    this circulation; and far less can it be true that the heating of the
    equatorial water by the sun is of so little importance that it may be
    “practically disregarded.”</p>

  <p><em>Supposed Influence of Heat derived from the Earth’s Crust.</em>—There is,
    according to Dr. Carpenter, another agent concerned in the production
    of the general oceanic circulation, viz., the heat derived by the
    bottom of the ocean from the crust of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> We have no reason
    to believe that the quantity of internal heat coming through the
    earth’s crust is greater in one part of the globe than in another; nor
    have we any grounds for concluding that the bottom of inter-tropical
    seas receives more heat from the earth’s crust than the bottom of those
    in polar regions. But if the polar seas receive as much heat from this
    source as the seas within the tropics, then the difference of density
    between the two cannot possibly be due to heat received from the
    earth’s crust; and this being so, it is mechanically impossible that
    internal heat can be a cause in the production of the general oceanic
    circulation.</p>

  <p><em>Circulation without Difference of Level.</em>—There is another part of
    the theory which appears to me irreconcilable with mechanics. It is
    maintained that this general circulation takes place without any
    difference of level between the equator and the poles. Referring to the
    case of the two cylinders W and C, which represent the equatorial and
    polar columns respectively, Dr. Carpenter says:—</p>

  <p>“The force which will thus lift up the entire column of water in W
    is that which causes the descent of the entire column in C, namely,
    the excess of gravity constantly acting in C,—the levels of the
    two columns, and consequently their heights, being maintained at a
    <em>constant equality</em> by the free passage of surface-water from W to C.”</p>

  <p>“The whole of Mr. Croll’s discussion of this question, however,” he
    continues, “proceeds upon the assumption that the levels of the polar
    and equatorial columns are <em>not kept at an</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span><em>equality</em>, &amp;c.” (§ 30.)
    And again, “Now, so far from asserting (as Captain Maury has done) that
    the trifling difference of level arising from inequality of temperature
    is adequate to the production of ocean-currents, I simply affirm that
    as fast as the level is disturbed by change of temperature it will be
    restored by gravity.” (§ 23.)<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_177" >
    <div class="caption">Fig. 3.</div>
    <img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="600" height="232" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>In order to understand more clearly how the circulation under
    consideration cannot take place without a difference of level, let W E
    (Fig. 3) represent the equatorial column, and C P the polar column. The
    equatorial column is warmer than the polar column because it receives
    <em>more</em> heat from the sun than the latter; and the polar is colder
    than the equatorial column because it receives <em>less</em>. The difference
    in the density of the two columns results from their difference of
    temperature; and the difference of temperature results in turn from the
    difference in the quantity of heat received from the sun by each. Or,
    to express the matter in other words, the difference of density (and
    consequently the circulation under consideration) is due to the excess
    of heat received from the sun by the equatorial over that received by
    the polar column; so that to leave out of account the super-heating of
    the inter-tropical waters by the sun is to leave out of account the
    very thing of all others that is absolutely essential to the existence
    of the circulation. The water being assumed to be the same in both
    columns and differing only as regards temperature, and the equatorial
    column possessing more heat than the polar, and being therefore less
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>dense than the latter, it follows, in order that the two columns may
    be in static equilibrium, that the surface of the equatorial column
    must stand at a higher level than that of the polar. This produces the
    slope W C from the equator to the pole. The extent of the slope will of
    course depend upon the extent of the difference of their temperatures.
    But, as was shown on a former occasion,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> it is impossible that
    static equilibrium can ever be fully obtained, because the slope
    occasioned by the elevation of the equatorial column above the polar
    produces what we may be allowed to call a <em>molecular</em> disturbance of
    equilibrium. The surface of the ocean, or the molecules of water lying
    on the slope, are not in a position of equilibrium, but tend, in virtue
    of gravity, to roll down the slope in the direction of the polar column
    C. It will be observed that the more we gain of static equilibrium
    of the entire ocean the greater is the slope, and consequently the
    greater is the disturbance of molecular equilibrium; and, <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>,
    the more molecular equilibrium is restored by the reduction of the
    slope, the greater is the disturbance of static equilibrium. <em>It is
    therefore absolutely impossible that both conditions of equilibrium can
    be fulfilled at the same time so long as a difference of temperature
    exists between the two columns.</em> And this conclusion holds true even
    though we should assume water to be a perfect fluid absolutely devoid
    of viscosity. It follows, therefore, that a general oceanic circulation
    without a difference of level is a <em>mechanical impossibility</em>.</p>

  <p>In a case of actual circulation due to difference of gravity, there
    is always a constant disturbance of both <em>static</em> and molecular
    equilibrium. Column C is always higher and column W always lower than
    it ought to be were the two in equilibrium; but they never can be at
    the same level.</p>

  <p>It is quite conceivable, of course, that the two conditions of
    equilibrium may be fulfilled alternately. We can conceive column C
    remaining stationary till the water flowing from column W has restored
    the level. And after the level is restored <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>we can conceive the polar
    column C sinking and the equatorial column W rising till the two
    perfectly balance each other. Such a mode of circulation, consisting
    of an alternate surface-flow and vertical descent and ascent of the
    columns, though conceivable, is in reality impossible in nature; for
    there are no means by which the polar column C could be supported
    from sinking till the level had been restored. But Dr. Carpenter does
    not assume that the general oceanic circulation takes place in this
    intermitting manner; according to him, the circulation is <em>constant</em>.
    He asserts that there is a “<em>continual</em> transference of water from the
    bottom of C to the bottom of W, and from the top of W to the top of C,
    with a <em>constant</em> descending movement in C and a <em>constant</em> ascending
    movement in W” (§ 29). But such a condition of things is irreconcilable
    with the idea of “the levels of the two columns, and consequently their
    heights, being maintained at a <em>constant</em> equality” (§ 29).</p>

  <p>Although Dr. Carpenter does not admit the existence of a permanent
    difference of level between the equator and the pole, he nevertheless
    speaks of a depression of level in the polar basin resulting from the
    contraction by cooling of the water flowing into it. This reduction of
    level induces an inflow of water from the surrounding area; “and since
    what is drawn away,” to quote his own words, “is supplied from a yet
    greater distance, the continued cooling of the surface-stratum in the
    polar basin will cause a ‘set’ of waters towards it, to be propagated
    backwards through the whole intervening ocean in communication with
    it until it reaches the tropical area.” The slope produced between
    the polar basin and the surrounding area, if sufficiently great, will
    enable the water in the surrounding area to flow polewards; but unless
    this slope extend to the equator, it will not enable the tropical
    waters also to flow polewards. One of two things necessarily follows:
    either the slope extends from the equator to the pole, or water can
    flow from the equator to the pole without a slope. If Dr. Carpenter
    maintains the former, he contradicts himself; and if he adopts the
    latter, he contradicts an obvious principle of mechanics.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

  <p><em>A Confusion of Ideas in Reference to the supposed Agency of Polar
    Cold.</em>—It seems to me that Dr. Carpenter has been somewhat misled by a
    slight confusion of ideas in reference to the supposed agency of polar
    cold. This is brought out forcibly in the following passage from his
    memoir in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xv.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Croll, in arguing against the doctrine of a general oceanic
    circulation sustained by difference of temperature, and <em>justly
    maintaining</em> that such a circulation cannot be produced by the
    application of heat at the surface, has entirely ignored the agency of
    cold.”</p>

  <p>It is here supposed that there are two agents at work in the production
    of the general oceanic circulation. The one agent is <em>heat</em>, acting
    at the equatorial regions; and the other agent is <em>cold</em>, acting at
    the polar regions. It is supposed that the agency of cold is far more
    powerful than that of heat. In fact so trifling is the agency of
    equatorial heat in comparison with that of polar cold that it may be
    “practically disregarded”—left out of account altogether,—polar cold
    being the <i lang="la">primum mobile</i> of the circulation. It is supposed also that
    I have considered the efficiency of one of the agents, viz., heat, and
    found it totally inadequate to produce the circulation in question; and
    it is admitted also that my conclusions are perfectly correct. But then
    I am supposed to have left out of account the other agent, viz., polar
    cold, the only agent possessing real potency. Had I taken into account
    polar cold, it is supposed that I should have found at once a cause
    perfectly adequate to produce the required effect.</p>

  <p>This is a fair statement of Dr. Carpenter’s views on the subject; I am
    unable, at least, to attach any other meaning to his words. And I have
    no doubt they are also the views which have been adopted by those who
    have accepted his theory.</p>

  <p>It must be sufficiently evident from what has already been stated,
    that the notion of there being two separate agents at work producing
    circulation, namely heat and cold, the one of which is assumed to have
    much more potency than the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> is not only opposed to the views
    entertained by physicists, but is also wholly irreconcilable with the
    ordinary principles of mechanics. But more than this, if we analyze the
    subject a little so as to remove some of the confusion of ideas which
    besets it, we shall find that these views are irreconcilable with even
    Dr. Carpenter’s own explanation of the cause of the general oceanic
    circulation.</p>

  <p><em>Cold</em> is not a something positive imparted to the polar waters giving
    them motion, and of which the tropical waters are deprived. If, dipping
    one hand into a basin filled with tropical water at 80° and the other
    into one filled with polar water at 32°, we refer to our <em>sensations</em>,
    we call the water in the one <em>hot</em> and that in the other <em>cold</em>; but
    so far as the water itself is concerned heat and cold simply mean
    difference in the amounts of heat possessed. Both the polar and the
    tropical water possess a certain amount of energy in the form of heat,
    only the polar water does not possess so much of it as the tropical.</p>

  <p>How, then, according to Dr. Carpenter, does polar cold impart motion
    to the water? The warm water flowing in upon the polar column becomes
    chilled by cold, but it is not cooled below that of the water
    underneath; for, according to Dr. Carpenter, the ocean in polar regions
    is as cold and as dense underneath as at the surface. The cooled
    surface-water does not sink through the water underneath, like the
    surface-water of a pond chilled during a frosty night. “The descending
    motion in column C will not consist,” he says, “in a successional
    descent of surface-films from above downwards, but it will be a
    downward movement of the <em>entire mass</em>, as if water in a tall jar
    were being drawn off through an orifice at the bottom” (§ 29). There
    is a downward motion of the entire column, producing an outflow of
    water at the bottom towards the equatorial column W, which outflow is
    compensated by an inflow from the top of the equatorial column to the
    top of the polar column C. But what causes column C to descend? The
    cause of the descent is its excess of weight over that of column W.
    Column C descends and column W ascends, for the same reason that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
    a balance the heavy scale descends and the light scale rises. Column
    C descends not simply because it is cold, but because it is <em>colder</em>
    than column W. Column C descends not simply because in consequence of
    being cold it is dense and therefore heavy, but because in consequence
    of being cold it is <em>denser</em> and therefore <em>heavier</em> than column W.
    It might be as cold as frozen mercury and as heavy as lead; but it
    would not on that account descend unless it were heavier than column
    W. The descent of column C and ascent of column W, and consequently
    the general oceanic circulation, results, therefore, according to Dr.
    Carpenter’s explanation, from the <em>difference</em> in the weights of the
    two columns; and the difference in the weights of the two columns
    results from their <em>difference</em> of density; and the difference of
    density of the two columns in turn results from their <em>difference</em> of
    temperature. But it has already been proved that the difference of
    temperature between the polar and equatorial columns depends wholly on
    the difference in the amount of heat received by each from the sun. The
    equatorial column W possesses more heat than the polar column C, solely
    because it receives more heat from the sun than column C. Consequently
    Dr. Carpenter’s statement that the circulation is produced by polar
    cold rather than by equatorial heat, is just as much in contradiction
    to his own theory as it is to the principles of mechanics. Again, his
    admission that the general oceanic circulation “cannot be produced by
    the application of heat to the surface,” is virtually a giving up the
    whole point in debate; for according to his gravitation theory, and
    every form of that theory, the circulation results from <em>difference</em> of
    temperature between equatorial and polar seas; but this difference, as
    we have seen, is entirely owing to the difference in the amount of heat
    received from the sun at these two places. The heat received, however,
    is “surface-heat;” for it is at the surface that the ocean receives all
    its heat from the sun; and consequently if surface-heat cannot produce
    the effect required, nothing else can.</p>

  <p><em>M. Dubuat’s Experiments.</em>—Referring to the experiments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> M. Dubuat
    adduced by me to show that water would not run down a slope of 1
    in 1,820,000,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> he says, “Now the experiments of M. Dubuat had
    reference, not to the slow restoration of level produced by the motion
    of water on itself, but to the sensible movement of water flowing over
    solid surfaces and retarded by its friction against them” (§ 22).
    Dr. Carpenter’s meaning, I presume, is that if the incline consist
    of any solid substance, water will not flow down it; but if it be
    made of <em>water</em> itself, <em>water</em> will flow down it. But in M. Dubuat’s
    experiments it was only the molecules in actual <em>contact</em> with the
    solid incline that could possibly be retarded by friction against it.
    The molecules not in contact with the solid incline evidently rested
    upon an <em>incline of water</em>, and were at perfect liberty to roll down
    that incline if they chose; but they did not do so; and consequently M.
    Dubuat’s experiment proved that water will not flow over itself on an
    incline of 1 in 1,000,000.</p>

  <p><em>A Begging of the Question at Issue.</em>—“It is to be remembered,” says
    Dr. Carpenter, “that, however small the original amount of movement
    may be, a <em>momentum</em> tending to its continuance <em>must</em> be generated
    from the instant of its commencement; so that if the initiating force
    be in constant action, there will be a <em>progressive acceleration</em> of
    its rate, until the increase of resistance equalises the tendency to
    further acceleration. Now, if it be admitted that the propagation of
    the disturbance of equilibrium from one column to another is simply
    <em>retarded</em>, <em>not</em> prevented, by the viscosity of the liquid, I cannot
    see how the conclusion can be resisted, that the constantly maintained
    difference of gravity between the polar and equatorial columns really
    acts as a <i lang="la">vis viva</i> in maintaining a circulation between them” (§ 35).</p>

  <p>If it be true, as Dr. Carpenter asserts, that in the case of the
    general oceanic circulation advocated by him “viscosity” simply
    <em>retards</em> motion, but does not <em>prevent</em> it, I certainly agree with him
    “that the constantly maintained difference of gravity between the polar
    and equatorial columns really acts as a <i lang="la">vis <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>viva</i> in maintaining a
    circulation between them.” But to assert that it merely retards, but
    does not prevent, motion, is simply <em>begging the question at issue</em>.
    It is an established principle that if the <em>force</em> resisting motion be
    greater than the force tending to produce it, then no motion can take
    place and no work can be performed. The experiments of M. Dubuat prove
    that the <em>force</em> of the molecular resistance of water to motion is
    <em>greater</em> than the <em>force</em> derived from a slope of 1 in 1,000,000; and
    therefore it is simply begging the question at issue to assert that it
    is <em>less</em>. The experiments of MM. Barlow, Rainey, and others, to which
    he alludes, are scarcely worthy of consideration in relation to the
    present question, because we know nothing whatever regarding the actual
    amount of force producing motion of the water in these experiments,
    further than that it must have been enormously greater than that
    derived from a slope of 1 in 1,000,000.</p>

  <p><em>Supposed Argument from the Tides.</em>—Dr. Carpenter advances Mr.
    Ferrel’s argument in regard to the tides. The power of the moon to
    disturb the earth’s water, he asserts, is, according to Herschel,
    only 1/11,400,000th part of gravity, and that of the sun not over
    1/25,736,400th part of gravity; yet the moon’s attractive force, even
    when counteracted by the sun, will produce a rise of the ocean. But as
    the disturbance of gravity produced by difference of temperature is far
    greater than the above, it ought to produce circulation.</p>

  <p>It is here supposed that the force exerted by gravity on the ocean,
    resulting from difference of temperature, tending to produce the
    general oceanic circulation, is much greater than the force exerted
    on the ocean by the moon in the production of the tides. But if we
    examine the subject we shall find that the opposite is the case. The
    attraction of the moon tending to lift the waters of the ocean acts
    directly on every molecule from the surface to the bottom; but the
    force of gravity tending to produce the circulation in question acts
    directly on only a portion of the ocean. Gravity can exercise no direct
    force in impelling the underflow from the polar to the equatorial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
    regions, nor in raising the water to the surface when it reaches the
    equatorial regions. Gravity can exercise no direct influence in pulling
    the water horizontally along the earth’s surface, nor in raising it
    up to the surface. The pull of gravity is always <em>downwards</em>, never
    <em>horizontally</em> nor upwards. Gravity will tend to pull the surface-water
    from the equator to the poles because here we have <em>descent</em>. Gravity
    will tend to sink the polar column because here also we have <em>descent</em>.
    But these are the only parts of the circuit where gravity has any
    tendency to produce motion. Motion in the other parts of the circuit,
    viz., along the bottom of the ocean from the poles to the equator and
    in raising the equatorial column, is produced by the <em>pressure</em> of the
    polar column; and consequently it is only <em>indirectly</em> that gravity may
    be said to produce motion in those parts. It is true that on certain
    portions of the ocean the force of gravity tending to produce motion is
    greater than the force of the moon’s attraction, tending to produce the
    tides; but this portion of the ocean is of inconsiderable extent. The
    total force of gravity acting on the entire ocean tending to produce
    circulation is in reality prodigiously less than the total force of the
    moon tending to produce the tides.</p>

  <p>It is no doubt a somewhat difficult problem to determine accurately
    the total amount of force exercised by gravity on the ocean; but for
    our present purpose this is not necessary. All that we require at
    present is a very rough estimate indeed. And this can be attained by
    very simple considerations. Suppose we assume the mean depth of the
    sea to be, say, three miles. The mean depth may yet be found to be
    somewhat less than this, or it may be found to be somewhat greater;
    a slight mistake, however, in regard to the mass of the ocean will
    not materially affect our conclusions. Taking the depth at 3 miles,
    the force or direct pull of gravity on the entire waters of the ocean
    tending to the production of the general circulation will not amount to
    more than 1/24,000,000,000th that of gravity, or only about 1/2,100th
    that of the attraction of the moon in the production of the tides. Let
    it be observed that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> referring to the force or pull of gravity,
    and not to hydrostatic pressure.</p>

  <p>The moon, by raising the waters of the ocean, will produce a slope of 2
    feet in a quadrant; and because the raised water sinks and the level is
    restored, Mr. Ferrel concludes that a similar slope of 2 feet produced
    by difference of temperature will therefore be sufficient to produce
    motion and restore level. But it is overlooked that the restoration of
    level in the case of the tides is as truly the work of the moon as the
    disturbance of that level is. For the water raised by the attraction of
    the moon at one time is again, six hours afterwards, pulled down by the
    moon when the earth has turned round a quadrant.</p>

  <p>No doubt the earth’s gravity alone would in course of time restore
    the level; but this does not follow as a logical consequence from Mr.
    Ferrel’s premises. If we suppose a slope to be produced in the ocean by
    the moon and the moon’s attraction withdrawn so as to allow the water
    to sink to its original level, the raised side will be the heaviest and
    the depressed side the lightest; consequently the raised side will tend
    to sink and the depressed side will tend to rise, in order that the
    ocean may regain its static equilibrium. But when a difference of level
    is produced by difference of temperature, the raised side is always the
    lightest and the depressed side is always the heaviest; consequently
    the very effort which the ocean makes to maintain its equilibrium
    tends to prevent the level being restored. The moon produces the tides
    chiefly by means of a simple yielding of the entire ocean considered as
    a mass; whereas in the case of a general oceanic circulation the level
    is restored by a <em>flow</em> of water at or near the surface. Consequently
    the amount of friction and molecular resistance to be overcome in the
    restoration of level in the latter case is much greater than in the
    former. The moon, as the researches of Sir William Thomson show, will
    produce a tide in a globe composed of a substance where no currents or
    general flow of the materials could possibly take place.</p>

  <p><em>Pressure as a Cause of Circulation.</em>—We shall now briefly refer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> to
    the influence of pressure (the indirect effects of gravity) in the
    production of the circulation under consideration. That which causes
    the polar column C to descend and the equatorial column W to ascend,
    as has repeatedly been remarked, is the difference in the weight of
    the two columns. The efficient cause in the production of the movement
    is, properly speaking, gravity; <em>cold</em> at the poles and <em>heat</em> at the
    equator, or, what is the same thing, the <em>excess</em> of heat received
    by the equator over that received by the poles is what maintains the
    difference of temperature between the two columns, and consequently is
    that also which maintains the difference of weight between them. In
    other words, difference of temperature is the cause which maintains
    the <em>state of disturbed equilibrium</em>. But the efficient cause of
    the circulation in question is gravity. Gravity, however, could not
    act without this state of disturbed equilibrium; and difference of
    temperature may therefore be called, in relation to the circulation,
    a necessary <em>condition</em>, while gravity may be termed the <em>cause</em>.
    Gravity sinks column C <em>directly</em>, but it raises column W <em>indirectly</em>
    by means of pressure. The same holds true in regard to the motion of
    the bottom-waters from C to W, which is likewise due to pressure. The
    pressure of the excess of the weight of column C over that of column W
    impels the bottom-water equatorwards and lifts the equatorial column.
    But on this point I need not dwell, as I have in the preceding chapter
    entered into a full discussion as to how this takes place.</p>

  <p>We come now to the most important part of the inquiry, viz., how is
    the surface-water impelled from the equator to the poles? Is pressure
    from behind the impelling force here as in the case of the bottom-water
    of the ocean? It seems to me that, in attempting to account for the
    surface-flow from the equator to the poles, Dr. Carpenter’s theory
    signally fails. The force to which he appeals appears to be wholly
    inadequate to produce the required effect.</p>

  <p>The experiments of M. Dubuat, as already noticed, prove that, any slope
    which can possibly result from the difference of temperature <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>between
    the equator and the poles is wholly insufficient to enable gravity to
    move the waters; but it does not necessarily prove that the <em>pressure</em>
    resulting from the raised water at the equator may not be sufficient to
    produce motion. This point will be better understood from the following
    figure, where, as before, P C represents the polar column and E W the
    equatorial column.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_188" >
    <div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div>
    <img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="600" height="218" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>It will be observed that the water in that wedge-shaped portion W C
    W′ forming the incline cannot be in a state of static equilibrium.
    A molecule of water at O, for example, will be pressed more in the
    direction of C than in the direction of W′, and the amount of this
    excess of pressure towards C will depend upon the height of W above
    the line C W′. It is evident that the pressure tending to move the
    molecule at O towards C will be far greater than the direct pull of
    gravity tending to draw a molecule at O′ lying on the surface of the
    incline towards C. The experiments of M. Dubuat prove that the direct
    force of gravity will not move the molecule at O′—that is, cause it to
    roll down the incline W C; but they do not prove that it may not yield
    to pressure from above, or that the pressure of the column W W′ will
    not move the molecule at O. The pressure is caused by gravity, and
    cannot, of course, enable gravity to perform more work than what is
    derived from the energy of gravity; it will enable gravity, however,
    to overcome resistance, which it could not do by direct action. But
    whether the pressure resulting from the greater height of the water
    at the equator due to its higher temperature be actually sufficient
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> produce displacement of the water is a question which I am wholly
    unable to answer.</p>

  <p>If we suppose 4 feet 6 inches to be the height of the equatorial
    surface above the polar required to make the two columns balance
    each other, the actual difference of level between the two columns
    will certainly not be more than one-half that amount, because, if a
    circulation exist, the weight of the polar column must always be in
    excess of that of the equatorial. But this excess can only be obtained
    at the expense of the surface-slope, as has already been shown at
    length. The surface-slope probably will not be more than 2 feet or 2
    feet 6 inches. Suppose the ocean to be of equal density from the poles
    to the equator, and that by some means or other the surface of the
    ocean at the equator is raised, say, 2 feet above that of the poles,
    then there can be little doubt that in such a case the water would
    soon regain its level; for the ocean at the equator being heavier than
    at the poles by the weight of a layer 2 feet in thickness, it would
    sink at the former place and rise at the latter until equilibrium was
    restored, producing, of course, a very slight displacement of the
    bottom-waters towards the poles. It will be observed, however, that
    restoration of level in this case takes place by a simple yielding, as
    it were, of the entire mass of the ocean without displacement of the
    molecules of the water over each other to any great extent. In the case
    of a slope produced by difference of temperature, however, the raised
    portion of the ocean is not heavier but lighter than the depressed
    portion, and consequently has no tendency to sink. Any movement which
    the ocean as a mass makes in order to regain equilibrium tends, as we
    have seen, rather to increase the difference of level than to reduce
    it. Restoration of level can only be produced by the forces which are
    in operation in the wedge-shaped mass W C W′, constituting the slope
    itself. But it will be observed by a glance at the Figure that, in
    order to the restoration of level, a large portion of the water W W′ at
    the equator will require to flow to C, the pole.</p>

  <p>According to the general <em>vertical</em> oceanic circulation theory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
    pressure from behind is not one of the forces employed in the
    production of the flow from the equator to the poles. This is evident;
    for there can be no pressure from behind acting on the water if there
    be no slope existing between the equator and the poles. Dr. Carpenter
    not only denies the actual existence of a slope, but denies the
    necessity for its existence. But to deny the existence of a slope is to
    deny the existence of pressure, and to deny the necessity for a slope
    is to deny the necessity for pressure. That in Dr. Carpenter’s theory
    the surface-water is supposed to be <em>drawn</em> from the equator to the
    poles, and not <em>pressed</em> forward by a force from behind, is further
    evident from the fact that he maintains that the force employed is not

    Work of the Gulf-stream.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I shall</span> now proceed by another method to prove the inadequacy of such
    a general oceanic circulation as that which Dr. Carpenter advocates.
    By contrasting the quantity of heat carried by the Gulf-stream from
    inter-tropical to temperate and polar regions with such amount as
    can possibly be conveyed in the same direction by means of a general
    oceanic circulation, it will become evident that the latter sinks into
    utter insignificance before the former.</p>

  <p>In my earlier papers on the amount of heat conveyed by the
    Gulf-stream,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> I estimated the volume of that stream as <em>equal
    to that</em> of a current 50 miles broad and 1,000 feet deep, flowing
    (from the surface to the bottom) at 4 miles an hour. Of course I did
    not mean, as Dr. Carpenter seems to suppose, that the stream at any
    particular place is 50 miles broad and 1,000 feet deep, or that it
    actually flows at the uniform rate of 4 miles an hour at surface and
    bottom. All I meant was, that the Gulf-stream is <em>equal to that</em> of
    a current of the above size and velocity. But in my recent papers on
    Ocean-currents, the substance of which appears in the present volume,
    to obviate any objections <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>on the grounds of having over-estimated the
    volume, I have taken that at one half this estimate, viz., equal to
    a current 50 miles broad and 1,000 feet deep flowing at the rate of
    2 miles an hour. I have estimated the mean temperature of the stream
    as it passes the Straits of Florida to be 65°, and have supposed that
    the water in its course becomes ultimately cooled down on an average
    to 40°. In this case each pound of water conveys 19,300 foot-pounds of
    heat from the Gulf of Mexico, to be employed in warming temperate and
    polar regions. Assuming these data to be correct, it follows that the
    amount of heat transferred from the Gulf of Mexico by this stream per
    day amounts to 77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds. This enormous
    quantity of heat is equal to one-fourth of all that is received from
    the sun by the whole of the Atlantic Ocean from the Tropic of Cancer up
    to the Arctic Circle.</p>

  <p>This is the amount of heat conveyed from inter-tropical to temperate
    and polar regions by the Gulf-stream. What now is the amount conveyed
    by means of the General Oceanic Circulation?</p>

  <p>According to this theory there ought to be as much warm water flowing
    from inter-tropical regions towards the Antarctic as towards the Arctic
    Circle. We may, therefore, in our calculations, consider that the heat
    which is received in tropical regions to the south of the equator goes
    to warm the southern hemisphere, and that received on the north side
    of the equator to warm the northern hemisphere. The warm currents
    found in the North Atlantic in temperate regions we may conclude came
    from the regions lying to the north of the equator,—or, in other
    words, from that part of the Atlantic lying between the equator and
    the Tropic of Cancer. At least, according to the gravitation theory,
    we have no reason to believe that the quantity of warm water flowing
    from tropical to temperate and polar regions in the Atlantic is
    greater than the area between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer
    can supply—because it is affirmed that a very large proportion of the
    cold water found in the North Atlantic comes, not from the arctic, but
    from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> antarctic regions. But if the North Atlantic is cooled by a
    cold stream from the southern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere in
    turn must be heated by a warm current from the North Atlantic—unless
    we assume that the compensating current flowing from the Atlantic into
    the southern hemisphere is as cold as the antarctic current, which is
    very improbable. But Dr. Carpenter admits that the quantity of warm
    water flowing from the Atlantic in equatorial regions towards the
    south is even greater than that flowing northwards. “The unrestricted
    communication,” he says, “which exists between the antarctic area and
    the great Southern Ocean-basins would involve, if the doctrine of a
    general oceanic circulation be admitted, a much more considerable
    interchange of waters between the antarctic and the equatorial areas
    than is possible in the northern hemisphere.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

  <p>We have already seen that, were it not for the great mass of warm water
    which finds its way to the polar regions, the temperature of these
    regions would be enormously lower than they really are. It has been
    shown likewise that the comparatively high temperature of north-western
    Europe is due to the same cause. But if it be doubtful whether the
    Gulf-stream reaches our shores, and if it be true that, even supposing
    it did, it “could only affect the <em>most superficial</em> stratum,” and
    that the great mass of warm water found by Dr. Carpenter in his
    dredging expeditions came directly from the equatorial regions, and not
    from the Gulf-stream, then the principal part of the heating-effect
    must be attributed, not to the Gulf-stream, but to the general flow
    of water from the equatorial regions. It surely would not, then, be
    too much to assume that the quantity of heat conveyed from equatorial
    regions by this general flow of water into the North Atlantic is at
    least equal to that conveyed by the Gulf-stream. If we assume this to
    be the amount of heat conveyed by the two agencies into the Atlantic
    from inter-tropical regions, it will, of course, be equal to twice that
    conveyed by the Gulf-stream alone.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

  <p>We shall now consider whether the area of the Atlantic to the north of
    the equator is sufficient to supply the amount of heat demanded by Dr.
    Carpenter’s theory.</p>

  <p>The entire area of the Atlantic, extending from the equator to the
    Tropic of Cancer, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico,
    is about 7,700,000 square miles.</p>

  <p>The quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream through the Straits of
    Florida is, as we have already endeavoured to show, equal to all the
    heat received from the sun by 1,560,935 square miles at the equator.
    The annual quantity of heat received from the sun by the torrid zone
    per unit surface, taking the mean of the whole zone, is to that
    received by the equator as 39 to 40, consequently the quantity of
    heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream is equal to all the heat received by
    1,600,960 square miles of the Atlantic in the torrid zone.</p>

  <p>But if, according to Dr. Carpenter’s views, the quantity of heat
    conveyed from the tropical regions is double that conveyed by the
    Gulf-stream, the amount of heat in this case conveyed into the Atlantic
    in temperate regions will be equal to all the heat received from the
    sun by 3,201,920 square miles of the Atlantic between the equator and
    the Tropic of Cancer. This is 32/77ths of all the heat received from
    the sun by that area.</p>

  <p>Taking the annual quantity received per unit surface at the equator at
    1,000, the quantities received by the three zones would be respectively
    as follows:—</p>

  <table summary="Heat quantities">

  </table>

  <p>Now, if we remove from the Atlantic in tropical regions 32/77ths of the
    heat received from the sun, we remove 405 parts from every 975 received
    from the sun, and consequently only 570 parts per unit surface remain.</p>

  <p>It has been shown<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> that the quantity of heat conveyed by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>the
    Gulf-stream from the equatorial regions into the temperate regions
    is equal to 100/412ths of all the heat received by the Atlantic in
    temperate regions. But according to the theory under consideration the
    quantity removed is double this, or equal to 100/206ths of all the heat
    received from the sun. But the amount received from the sun is equal
    to 757 parts per unit surface; add then to this 100/206ths of 757, or
    367, and we have 1,124 parts of heat per unit surface as the amount
    possessed by the Atlantic in temperate regions. The Atlantic should in
    this case be much warmer in temperate than in tropical regions; for
    in temperate regions it would possess 1,124 parts of heat per unit
    surface, whereas in tropical regions it would possess only 570 parts
    per unit surface. Of course the heat conveyed from tropical regions
    does not all remain in temperate regions; a very considerable portion
    of it must pass into the arctic regions. Let us, then, assume that
    one half goes to warm the Arctic Ocean, and the other half remains
    in the temperate regions. In this case 183·5 parts would remain, and
    consequently 757 + 183·5 = 940·5 parts would be the quantity possessed
    by the Atlantic in temperate regions, a quantity which still exceeds by
    no less than 370·5 parts the heat possessed by the Atlantic in tropical
    regions.</p>

  <p>As one half of the amount of heat conveyed from the tropical regions
    is assumed to go into the Arctic Ocean, the quantity passing into
    that ocean would therefore be equal to that which passes through the
    Straits of Florida, an amount which, as we have found, is equal to all
    the heat received from the sun by 3,436,900 square miles of the Arctic
    Ocean.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The entire area covered by sea beyond the Arctic Circle is
    under 5,000,000 square miles; but taking the Arctic Ocean in round
    numbers at 5,000,000 square miles, the quantity of heat conveyed into
    it by currents to that received from the sun would therefore be as
    3,436,900 to 5,000,000.</p>

  <p>The amount received on the unit surface of the arctic regions we have
    seen to be 454 parts. The amount received from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>currents would
    therefore be 312 parts. This gives 766 parts of heat per unit surface
    as the quantity possessed by the Arctic Ocean. Thus the Arctic Ocean
    also would contain more heat than the Atlantic in tropical regions; for
    the Atlantic in these regions would, in the case under consideration,
    possess only 570 parts, while the Arctic Ocean would possess 766
    parts. It is true that more rays are cut off in arctic regions than in
    tropical; but still, after making due allowance for this, the Arctic
    Ocean, if the theory we are considering were true, ought to be as warm
    as, if not warmer than, the Atlantic in tropical regions. The relative
    quantities of heat possessed by the three zones would therefore be as
    follows:—</p>

  <p>It is here assumed, however, that none of the heat possessed by the
    Gulf-stream is derived from the southern hemisphere, which, we know,
    is not the case. But supposing that as much as one half of the heat
    possessed by the stream came from the southern hemisphere, and that the
    other half was obtained from the seas lying between the equator and the
    Tropic of Cancer, the relative proportions of heat possessed by the
    three zones per given area would be as follows:—</p>

  <p>This proves incontestably that, supposing there is such a general
    oceanic circulation as is maintained, the quantity of heat conveyed by
    means of it into the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans must be trifling
    in comparison with that conveyed by the Gulf-stream; for if it nearly
    equalled that conveyed by the Gulf-stream, then not only the North
    Atlantic in temperate regions, but even the Arctic Ocean itself would
    be much warmer than the inter-tropical seas. In fact, so far as the
    distribution of heat over the globe is concerned, it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> matter of
    indifference whether there really is or is not such a thing as this
    general oceanic circulation. The enormous amount of heat conveyed by
    the Gulf-stream alone puts it beyond all doubt that ocean-currents are
    the great agents employed in distributing over the globe the excess of
    heat received by the sea in inter-tropical regions.</p>

  <p>It is therefore, so far as concerns the theory of a General Oceanic
    Circulation, of the utmost importance that the advocates of that
    theory should prove that I have over-estimated the thermal power of
    the Gulf-stream. This, however, can only be done by detecting some
    error either in my computation or in the data on which it is based;
    yet neither Dr. Carpenter nor any one else, as far as I know, has
    challenged the accuracy of my figures. The question at issue is the
    correctness of the data; but the only part of the data which can
    possibly admit of being questioned is my estimate of the <em>volume</em>
    and <em>temperature</em> of the stream. Dr. Carpenter, however, does not
    maintain that I have over-estimated the temperature of the stream; on
    the contrary, he affirms that I have really under-estimated it. “If we
    assume,” he remarks, “the limit of the stratum above 60° as that of
    the real Gulf-stream current, we shall find its average temperature to
    be somewhat higher than it has been stated by Mr. Croll, who seems to
    have taken 65° as the average of the water flowing through the entire
    channel. The average surface temperature of the Florida channel for
    the whole year is 80°; and we may fairly set the average of the entire
    outgoing stream, down to the plane of 60°, at 70°, instead of 65° as
    estimated by Mr. Croll” (§ 141). It follows, then, that every pound of
    water of the Gulf-stream actually conveys 5 units of heat more than
    I have estimated it to do—the amount conveyed being 30 units instead
    of 25 units as estimated by me. Consequently, if the Gulf-stream be
    equal to that of a current of merely 41½ miles broad and 1,000 feet
    deep, flowing at the rate of 2 miles an hour, it will still convey the
    estimated quantity of heat. But this estimate of the volume of the
    stream, let it be observed, barely exceeds <em>one-third</em> of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> given
    by Herschel, Maury, and Colding,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and is little more than one-half
    that assigned to it by Mr. Laughton, while it very little exceeds that
    given by Mr. Findlay,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> an author whom few will consider likely to
    overrate either the volume or heating-power of the stream.</p>

  <p>The important results obtained during the <cite>Challenger</cite> expedition have
    clearly proved that I have neither over-estimated the temperature nor
    the volume of the Gulf-stream. Between Bermuda and Sandy Hook the
    stream is 60 miles broad and 600 feet deep, with a maximum velocity of
    from 3½ to 4 miles an hour. If the mean velocity of the entire section
    amounts to 2¼ miles an hour, which it probably does, the volume of the
    stream must equal that given in my estimate. But we have no evidence
    that all the water flowing through the Straits of Florida passes
    through the section examined by the officers of the <cite>Challenger</cite>. Be
    this, however, as it may, the observations made between St. Thomas
    and Sandy Hook reveal the existence of an immense flow of warm water,
    2,300 feet deep, entirely distinct from the water included in the above
    section of the Gulf-stream proper. As the thickest portion of this
    immense body of water joins the warm water of the Gulf-stream, Captain
    Nares considers that “it is evidently connected with it, and probably
    as an offshoot.” At Sandy Hook, according to him, it extends 1,200
    feet deeper than the Gulf-stream itself, but off Charleston, 600 miles
    nearer the source, the same temperature is found at the same depth.
    But whether it be an offshoot of the Gulf-stream or not, one thing is
    certain, it can only come from the Gulf of Mexico or from the Caribbean
    Sea. This mass of water, after flowing northwards for about 1,000
    miles, turns to the right and crosses the Atlantic in the direction of
    the Azores, where it appears to thin out.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, we take into account the combined heat conveyed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>by
    both streams, my estimate of the heat transferred from inter-tropical
    regions into the North Atlantic will be found rather under than above
    the truth.</p>

  <p><em>Dr. Carpenter’s Estimate of the Thermal Work of the Gulf-stream.</em>—In
    the appendix to an elaborate memoir on Oceanic Circulation lately
    read before the Geographical Society, Dr. Carpenter endeavours to
    show that I have over-estimated the thermal work of the Gulf-stream.
    In that memoir<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> he has also favoured us with his own estimate of
    the sectional area, rate of flow, and temperature of the stream. Even
    adopting his data, however, I find myself unable to arrive at his
    conclusions.</p>

  <p>Let us consider first his estimate of the sectional area of the
    stream. He admits that “it is impossible, in the present state of our
    knowledge, to arrive at any exact estimate of the sectional area of the
    stream; since it is for the most part only from the temperatures of
    its different strata that we can judge whether they are, or are not,
    in movement, and what is the direction of their movement.” Now it is
    perfectly evident that our estimate of the sectional area of the stream
    will depend upon what we assume to be its bottom temperature. If, for
    example, we assume 70° to be the bottom temperature, we shall have a
    small sectional area. Taking the temperature at 60°, the sectional
    area will be larger, and if 50° be assumed to be the temperature, the
    sectional area will be larger still, and so on. Now the small sectional
    area obtained by Dr. Carpenter arises from the fact of his having
    assumed the high temperature of 60° to be that of the bottom of the
    stream. He concludes that all the water below 60° has an inward flow,
    and that it is only that portion from 60° and upwards which constitutes
    the Gulf-stream. I have been unable to find any satisfactory evidence
    for assuming so high a temperature for the bottom of the stream. It
    must be observed that the water underlying the Gulf-stream is not
    the ordinary water of the Atlantic, but the cold current from the
    arctic regions. In fact, it is the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>water which reaches the
    equator at almost every point with a temperature not much above the
    freezing-point. It is therefore highly improbable that the under
    surface of the Gulf-stream has a temperature so high as 60°.</p>

  <p>Dr. Carpenter’s method of measuring the mean velocity of the
    Gulf-stream is equally objectionable. He takes the mean annual rate at
    the surface in the “Narrows” to be two miles an hour and the rate at
    the bottom to be zero, and he concludes from this that the average rate
    of the whole is one mile an hour—the arithmetical mean between these
    two extremes. Now it will be observed that this conclusion only holds
    true on the supposition that the breadth of the stream is as great at
    the bottom as at the surface, which of course it is not. All admit that
    the sides of the Gulf-stream are not perpendicular, but slope somewhat
    in the manner of the banks of a river. The stream is broad at the
    surface and narrows towards the bottom. It is therefore evident that
    the upper half of the section has a much larger area than the lower;
    the quantity of water flowing through the upper half with a greater
    velocity than one mile an hour must be much larger than the quantity
    flowing through the lower half with a less velocity than one mile an
    hour.</p>

  <p>His method of estimating the mean temperature of the stream is even
    more objectionable. He says, “The average surface temperature of the
    Florida Channel for the whole year is 80°, and we may set the average
    of the entire outgoing stream down to the plane of 60° at 70°, instead
    of 65°, as estimated by Mr. Croll.” If 80° be the surface and 60° be
    the bottom temperature, temperature and rate of velocity being assumed
    of course to decrease uniformly from the surface downwards, how is it
    possible that 70° can be the average temperature? The amount of water
    flowing through the upper half of the section, with a temperature above
    70°, is far more than the amount flowing through the under half of the
    section, with a temperature below 70°. Supposing the lower half of the
    section to be as large as the upper half, which it is not, still the
    quantity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> water flowing through it would only equal one-third of
    that flowing through the upper half, because the mean velocity of the
    water in the lower half would be only half a mile per hour, whereas
    the mean velocity of that in the upper half would be a mile and a half
    an hour. But the area of the lower half is much less than that of the
    upper half, consequently the amount of water whose temperature is under
    70° must be even much under one-third of that, the temperature of which
    is above 70°.</p>

  <p>Had Dr. Carpenter taken the proper method of estimating the mean
    temperature, he would have found that 75°, even according to his own
    data, was much nearer the truth than 70°. I pointed out, several years
    ago,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the fallacy of estimating the mean temperature of a stream in
    this way.</p>

  <p>So high a mean temperature as 75° for the Gulf-stream, even in the
    Florida Channel, is manifestly absurd, but if 60° be the bottom
    temperature of the stream, the mean temperature cannot possibly be much
    under that amount. It is, of course, by under-estimating the sectional
    area of the stream that its mean temperature is over-estimated. We
    cannot reduce the mean temperature without increasing the sectional
    area. If my estimate of 65° be taken as the mean temperature, which I
    have little doubt will yet be found to be not far from the truth, Dr.
    Carpenter’s estimate of the sectional area must be abandoned. For if
    65° be the mean temperature of the stream, its bottom temperature must
    be far under 60°, and if the bottom temperature be much under 60°, then
    the sectional area must be greater than he estimates it to be.</p>

  <p>Be this, however, as it may; even if we suppose that 60° will
    eventually be found to be the actual bottom temperature of the
    Gulf-stream, nevertheless, if the total quantity of heat conveyed by
    the stream from inter-tropical regions be estimated in the proper way,
    we shall still find that amount to be so enormous, that there is not
    sufficient heat remaining in those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>regions to supply Dr. Carpenter’s
    oceanic circulation with a quantity as great for distribution in the
    North Atlantic.</p>

  <p>It therefore follows (and so far as regards the theory of Secular
    changes of climate, this is all that is worth contending for) that
    Ocean-currents and not a General Oceanic Circulation resulting from
    gravity, are the great agents employed in the distribution of heat over
    the globe.</p>

    Temperature of a Cross Section less than Mean Temperature
    of Stream.—Reason of such Diversity of Opinion regarding
    Ocean-currents.—More rigid Method of Investigation necessary.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the conclusion of the reading of Dr. Carpenter’s paper before the
    Royal Geographical Society, on January 9th, 1871, Mr. Findlay made the
    following remarks:—</p>

  <p>“When, by the direction of the United States Government, ten or eleven
    years ago, the narrowest part of the Gulf-stream was examined, figures
    were obtained which shut out all idea of its ever reaching our shores
    as a heat-bearing current. In the narrowest part, certainly not more
    than from 250 to 300 cubic miles of water pass per diem. Six months
    afterwards that water reaches the banks of Newfoundland, and nine or
    twelve months afterwards the coast of England, by which time it is
    popularly supposed to cover an area of 1,500,000 square miles. The
    proportion of the water that passes through the Gulf of Florida will
    not make a layer of water more than 6 inches thick per diem over such
    a space. Every one knows how soon a cup of tea cools; and yet it is
    commonly imagined that a film of only a few inches in depth, after the
    lapse of so long a time, has an effect upon our climate. There is no
    need for calculations; the thing is self-evident.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

  <p>About five years ago, Mr. Findlay objected to the conclusions which I
    had arrived at regarding the enormous heating-power of the Gulf-stream
    on the ground that I had over-estimated the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>volume of the stream. He
    stated that its volume was only about the half of what I had estimated
    it to be. To obviate this objection, I subsequently reduced the volume
    to one-half of my former estimate.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> But taking the volume at this
    low estimate, it was nevertheless found that the quantity of heat
    conveyed into the Atlantic through the Straits of Florida by means of
    the stream was equal to about <em>one-fourth</em> of all the heat received
    from the sun by the Atlantic from the latitude of the Strait of Florida
    up to the Arctic Circle.</p>

  <p>Mr. Findlay, in his paper read before the British Association, affirmed
    that the volume of the stream is somewhere from 294 to 333 cubic miles
    per day; but in his remarks at the close of Dr. Carpenter’s address, he
    stated it to be not greater than from 250 to 300 cubic miles per day. I
    am unable to reconcile any of those figures with the data from which he
    appears to have derived them. In his paper to the British Association,
    he remarks that “the Gulf-stream at its outset is not more than 39½
    miles wide, and 1,200 feet deep.” From all attainable data, he computes
    the mean annual rate of motion to be 65·4 miles per day; but as the
    rate decreases with the depth, the mean velocity of the whole mass does
    not exceed 49·4 miles per day. When he speaks of the mean velocity of
    the Gulf-stream being so and so, he must refer to the mean velocity at
    some particular place. This is evident; for the mean velocity entirely
    depends upon the sectional area of the stream. The place where the
    mean velocity is 49·4 miles per day must be the place where it is 39½
    miles broad and 1,200 feet deep; for he is here endeavouring to show us
    how small the volume of the stream actually is. Now, unless the mean
    velocity refers to the place where he gives us the breadth and depth
    of the stream, his figures have no bearing on the point in question.
    But a stream 39½ miles broad and 1,200 feet deep has a sectional area
    of 8·97 square miles, and this, with a mean velocity of 49·4 miles
    per day, will give 443 cubic miles of water. The amount, according to
    my estimate, is 459 cubic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>miles per day; it therefore exceeds Mr.
    Findlay’s estimate by only 16 cubic miles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Findlay does not, as far as I know, consider that I have
    over-estimated the mean temperature of the stream. He states<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> that
    between Sand Key and Havana the Gulf-stream is about 1,200 feet deep,
    and that it does not reach the summit of a submarine ridge, which he
    states has a temperature of 60°. It is evident, then, that the bottom
    of the stream has a temperature of at least 60°, which is within 5° of
    what I regard as the mean temperature of the mass. But the surface of
    the stream is at least 17° above this mean. Now, when we consider that
    it is at the upper parts of the stream, the place where the temperature
    is so much above 65°, that the motion is greatest, it is evident that
    the mean temperature of the entire moving mass must, according to Mr.
    Findlay, be considerably over 65°. It therefore follows, according
    to his own data, that the Gulf-stream conveys into the Atlantic an
    amount of heat equal to one-fourth of all the heat which the Atlantic,
    from the latitude of the Straits of Florida up to the arctic regions,
    derives from the sun.</p>

  <p>But it must be borne in mind that although the mean temperature of the
    cross section should be below 65°, it does not therefore follow that
    the mean temperature of the <em>water flowing through this cross section</em>
    must be below that temperature, for it is perfectly obvious that the
    mean temperature of the mass of water flowing through the cross section
    in a given time must be much higher than that of the cross section
    itself. The reason is very simple. It is in the upper half of the
    section where the high temperature exists; but as the velocity of the
    stream is much greater in its upper than in its lower half, the greater
    portion of the water passing through this cross section is water of
    high temperature.</p>

  <p>But even supposing we were to halve Mr. Findlay’s own estimate, and
    assume that the volume of the stream is equal to only 222 cubic miles
    of water per day instead of 443, still the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>amount of heat conveyed
    would be equal to one-eighth part of the heat received from the sun by
    the Atlantic. But would not the withdrawal of an amount of heat equal
    to one-eighth of that received from the sun greatly affect the climate
    of the Atlantic? Supposing we take the mean temperature of the Atlantic
    at, say, 56°; this will make its temperature 295° above that of space.
    Extinguish the sun and stop the Gulf-stream, and the temperature ought
    to sink 295°. How far, then, ought the temperature to sink, supposing
    the sun to remain and the Gulf-stream to stop? Would not the withdrawal
    of the stream cause the temperature to sink some 30°? Of course, if
    the Gulf-stream were withdrawn and everything else were to remain the
    same, the temperature of the Atlantic would not actually remain 30°
    lower than at present; for heat would flow in from all sides and partly
    make up for the loss of the stream. But nevertheless 30° represents the
    amount of temperature maintained by means of the heat from the stream.
    And this, be it observed, is taking the volume of the stream at a lower
    estimate than even Mr. Findlay himself would be willing to admit. Mr.
    Findlay says that, by the time the Gulf-stream reaches the shores of
    England, it is supposed to cover a space of 1,500,000 square miles.
    “The proportion of water that passes through the Straits of Florida
    will not make,” according to him, “a layer of water more than 6 inches
    thick per diem over such a space.” But a layer of water 6 inches thick
    cooling 25° will give out 579,000 foot-pounds of heat per square foot.
    If, therefore, the Gulf-stream, as he asserts, supplies 6 inches per
    day to that area, then every square foot of the area gives off per
    day 579,000 foot-pounds of heat. The amount of heat received from the
    sun per square foot in latitude 55°, which is not much above the mean
    latitude of Great Britain, is 1,047,730 foot-pounds per day, taking, of
    course, the mean of the whole year; <em>consequently this layer of water
    gives out an amount of heat equal to more than</em> one-half <em>of all that
    is received from the sun</em>. But assuming that the stream should leave
    the half of its heat on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> American shores and carry to the shores of
    Britain only 12½° of heat, still we should have 289,500 foot-pounds per
    square foot, which notwithstanding <em>is more than equal to</em> one-fourth
    <em>of that received from the sun</em>. If an amount of heat so enormous
    cannot affect climate, what can?</p>

  <p>I shall just allude to one other erroneous notion which prevails in
    regard to the Gulf-stream; but it is an error which I by no means
    attribute either to Mr. Findlay or to Dr. Carpenter. The error to which
    I refer is that of supposing that when the Gulf-stream widens out to
    hundreds of miles, as it does before it reaches our shores, its depth
    must on this account be much less than when it issues from the Gulf of
    Mexico. Although the stream may be hundreds of miles in breadth, there
    is no necessity why it should be only 6 inches, or 6 feet, or 60 feet,
    or even 600 feet in depth. It may just as likely be 6,000 feet deep as
    6 inches.</p>

  <p><em>The Reason why such Diversity of Opinion prevails in Regard to
    Ocean-currents.</em>—In conclusion I venture to remark that more than
    nine-tenths of all the error and uncertainty which prevail, both
    in regard to the cause of ocean-currents and to their influence on
    climate, is due, not, as is generally supposed, to the intrinsic
    difficulties of the subject, but rather to the defective methods
    which have hitherto been employed in its investigation—that is, in
    not treating the subject according to the rigid methods adopted in
    other departments of physics. What I most particularly allude to is
    the disregard paid to the modern method of determining the amount of
    effects in <em>absolute measure</em>.</p>

  <p>But let me not be misunderstood on this point. I by no means suppose
    that the <em>absolute quantity</em> is the thing always required for its
    own sake. It is in most cases required simply as a means to an end;
    and very often that end is the knowledge of the <em>relative</em> quantity.
    Take, for example, the Gulf-stream. Suppose the question is asked,
    to what extent does the heat conveyed by that stream influence the
    climate of the North Atlantic? In order to the proper answering of this
    question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> the principal thing required is to know what proportion the
    amount of heat conveyed by the stream into the Atlantic bears to that
    received from the sun by that area. We want the <em>relative proportions</em>
    of these two quantities. But how are we to obtain them? We can only
    do so by determining first the <em>absolute</em> quantity of each. We must
    first measure each before we can know how much the one is greater
    than the other, or, in other words, before we can know their relative
    proportions. We have the means of determining the absolute amount
    of heat received from the sun by a given area at any latitude with
    tolerable accuracy; but the same cannot be done with equal accuracy in
    regard to the amount of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream, because the
    volume and mean temperature of the stream are not known with certainty.
    Nevertheless we have sufficient data to enable us to fix upon such a
    maximum and minimum value to these quantities as will induce us to
    admit that the truth must lie somewhere between them. In order to give
    full justice to those who maintain that the Gulf-stream exercises
    but little influence on climate, and to put an end to all further
    objections as to the uncertainty of my data, I shall take a minimum
    to which none of them surely can reasonably object, viz. that the
    volume of the stream is not over 230 cubic miles per day, and the heat
    conveyed per pound of water not over 12½ units. Calculating from these
    data, we find that the amount of heat carried into the North Atlantic
    is equal to one-sixteenth of all the heat received from the sun by that
    area. There are, I presume, few who will not admit that the actual
    proportion is much higher than this, probably as high as 1 to 3, or 1
    to 4. But, who, without adopting the method I have pursued, could ever
    have come to the conclusion that the proportion was even 1 to 16? He
    might have guessed it to be 1 to 100 or 1 to 1000, but he never would
    have guessed it to be 1 to 16. Hence the reason why the great influence
    of the Gulf-stream as a heating agent has been so much under-estimated.</p>

  <p>The same remarks apply to the gravitation theory of the cause of
    currents. Viewed simply as a theory it looks very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> reasonable. There
    is no one acquainted with physics but will admit that the tendency of
    the difference of temperature between the equator and the poles is
    to cause a surface current from the equator towards the poles, and
    an under current from the poles to the equator. But before we can
    prove that this tendency does actually produce such currents, another
    question must be settled, viz. is this force sufficiently great to
    produce the required motion? Now when we apply the method to which I
    refer, and determine the absolute amount of the force resulting from
    the difference of specific gravity, we discover that not to be the
    powerful agent which the advocates of the gravitation theory suppose,
    but a force so infinitesimal as not to be worthy of being taken into
    account when considering the causes by which currents are produced.</p>

  <p><em>Ocean-currents not due alone to the Trade-winds.</em>—The generally
    received opinion amongst the advocates of the wind theory of oceanic
    circulation is that the Gulf-stream and other currents of the ocean are
    due to the impulse of the trade-winds. The tendency of the trade-winds
    is to impel the inter-tropical waters along the line of the equator
    from east to west; and were those regions not occupied in some places
    by land, this equatorial current would flow directly round the
    globe. Its westward progress, however, is arrested by the two great
    continents, the old and the new. On approaching the land the current
    bifurcates, one portion trending northwards and the other southwards.
    The northern branch of the equatorial current of the Atlantic passes
    into the Caribbean Sea, and after making a circuit of the Gulf of
    Mexico, flows northward and continues its course into the Arctic
    Ocean. The southern branch, on the other hand, is deflected along the
    South-American coast, constituting what is known as the Brazilian
    current. In the Pacific a similar deflection occurs against the
    Asiatic coast, forming a current somewhat resembling the Gulf-stream,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>a portion of which (Kamtschatka current) in like manner passes into
    the arctic regions. In reference to all these various currents, the
    impelling cause is supposed to be the force of the trade-winds.</p>

  <p>It is, however, urged as an objection by Maury and other advocates of
    the gravitation theory, that a current like the Gulf-stream, extending
    as far as the arctic regions, could not possibly be impelled and
    maintained by a force acting at the equatorial regions. But this is
    a somewhat weak objection. It seems to be based upon a misconception
    of the magnitude of the force in operation. It does not take into
    account that this force acts on nearly the whole area of the ocean in
    inter-tropical regions. If, in a basin of water, say three feet in
    diameter, a force is applied sufficient to produce a surface-flow one
    foot broad across the centre of the basin, the water impelled against
    the side will be deflected to the extremes of the vessel. And this
    result does not in any way depend upon the size of the basin. The
    same effect which occurs in a small basin will occur in a large one,
    provided the proportion between the breadth of the belt of water put in
    motion and the size of the vessel be the same in both cases. It does
    not matter, therefore, whether the diameter of the basin be supposed to
    be three feet, or three thousand miles, or ten thousand miles.</p>

  <p>There is a more formidable objection, however, to the theory.
    The trade-winds will account for the Gulf-stream, Brazil, Japan,
    Mozambique, and many other currents; but there are currents, such as
    some of the polar currents, which cannot be so accounted for. Take,
    for example, the great antarctic current flowing northward into the
    Pacific. This current does not bend to the left under the influence
    of the earth’s rotation and continue its course in a north-westerly
    direction, but actually bends round to the right and flows eastward
    against the South-American coast, in direct opposition both to the
    influence of rotation and to the trade-winds. The trade-wind theory,
    therefore, is insufficient to account for all the facts. But there is
    yet another explanation, which satisfactorily solves our difficulties.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>The currents of the ocean owe their origin, not to the trade-winds
    alone, but to the <em>prevailing</em> winds of the globe (including, of
    course, the trade-winds).</p>

  <p><em>Ocean-currents due to the System of Winds.</em>—If we leave out of account
    a few small inland sheets of water, the globe may be said to have but
    one sea, just as it possesses only one atmosphere. We have accustomed
    ourselves, however, to speak of parts or geographical divisions of
    the one great ocean, such as the Atlantic and the Pacific, as if they
    were so many separate oceans. And we have likewise come to regard the
    currents of the ocean as separate and independent of one another. This
    notion has no doubt to a considerable extent militated against the
    acceptance of the theory that the currents are caused by the winds, and
    not by difference of specific gravity; for it leads to the conclusion
    that currents in a sea must flow in the direction of the prevailing
    winds blowing over that particular sea. The proper view of the matter,
    as I hope to be able to show, is that which regards the various
    currents merely as members of one grand system of circulation produced,
    not by the trade-winds alone, nor by the prevailing winds proper alone,
    but by the combined action of all the prevailing winds of the globe,
    regarded as one system of circulation.</p>

  <p>If the winds be the impelling cause of currents, the <em>direction</em> of the
    currents will depend upon two circumstances, viz.:—(1) the direction
    of the prevailing winds of the globe, including, of course, under this
    term the prevailing winds proper and the trade-winds; and (2) the
    conformation of land and sea. It follows, therefore, that as a current
    in any given sea is but a member of a general system of circulation,
    its direction is determined, not alone by the prevailing winds blowing
    over the sea in question, but by the general system of prevailing
    winds. It may consequently sometimes happen that the general system
    of winds may produce a current directly opposite to the prevailing
    wind blowing over the current. The accompanying Chart (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I.</a>) shows
    how exactly the system of ocean-currents agrees with the system of
    the prevailing winds. The fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
    lines indicate the paths of the
    prevailing winds, and the fine arrows the direction in which the wind
    blows along those paths. The large arrows show the direction of the
    principal ocean-currents.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">CHART SHOWING the GENERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN the SYSTEM of OCEAN
      CURRENTS and WINDS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The directions and paths of the prevailing winds have been taken from
    Messrs. Johnston’s small physical Atlas, which, I find, agrees exactly
    with the direction of the prevailing winds as deduced from the four
    quarterly wind charts lately published by the Hydrographic Department
    of the Admiralty. The direction of the ocean-currents has been taken
    from the Current-chart published by the Admiralty.</p>

  <p>In every case, without exception, the direction of the main currents of
    the globe agrees exactly with the direction of the prevailing winds.
    There could not possibly be a more convincing proof that those winds
    are the cause of the ocean-currents than this general agreement of the
    two systems as indicated by the chart. Take, for example, the North
    Atlantic. The Gulf-stream follows exactly the path of the prevailing
    winds. The Gulf-stream bifurcates in mid-Atlantic; so does the wind.
    The left branch of the stream passes north-eastwards into the arctic
    regions, and the right branch south-eastwards by the Azores; so does
    the wind. The south-eastern branch of the stream, after passing the
    Canaries, re-enters the equatorial current and flows into the Gulf
    of Mexico; the same, it will be observed, holds true of the wind. A
    like remarkable agreement exists in reference to all the other leading
    currents of the ocean. This is particularly seen in the case of the
    great antarctic current between long. 140° W. and 160° W. This current,
    flowing northwards from the antarctic regions, instead of bending to
    the left under the influence of rotation, turns to the right when it
    enters the regions of the westerly winds, and flows eastwards towards
    the South-American shores. In fact, all the currents in this region of
    strong westerly winds flow in an easterly or north-easterly direction.</p>

  <p>Taking into account the effects resulting from the conformation of
    sea and land, the system of ocean-currents agrees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> precisely with
    the system of the winds. All the principal currents of the globe are
    in fact moving in the exact direction in which they ought to move,
    assuming the winds to be the sole impelling cause. In short, so perfect
    is the agreement between the two systems, that, given the system of
    winds and the conformation of sea and land, and the direction of all
    the currents of the ocean, or more properly the system of oceanic
    circulation, might be determined <i lang="la">à priori</i>. Or given the system of the
    ocean-currents together with the conformation of sea and land, and the
    direction of the prevailing winds could also be determined <i lang="la">à priori</i>.
    Or, thirdly, given the system of winds and the system of currents,
    and the conformation of sea and land might be roughly determined. For
    example, it can be shown by this means that the antarctic regions
    are probably occupied by a continent and not by a number of separate
    islands, nor by sea.</p>

  <p>While holding that the currents of the ocean form one system of
    circulation, we must not be supposed to mean that the various currents
    are connected end to end, having the same water flowing through them
    all in succession like that in a heating apparatus. All that is
    maintained is simply this, that the currents are so mutually related
    that any great change in one would modify the conditions of all the
    others. For example, a great increase or decrease in the easterly flow
    of antarctic water in the Southern Ocean would decrease or increase,
    as the case might be, the strength of the West Australian current;
    and this change would modify the equatorial current of the Indian
    Ocean, a modification which in like manner would affect the Agulhas
    current and the Southern Atlantic current—this last leading in turn
    to a modification of the equatorial current of the Atlantic, and
    consequently of the Brazilian current and the Gulf-stream. Furthermore,
    since a current impelled by the winds, as Mr. Laughton in his excellent
    paper on Ocean-currents justly remarks, tends to leave a vacancy
    behind, it follows that a decrease or increase in the Gulf-stream would
    affect the equatorial current, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> Agulhas current, and all the other
    currents back to the antarctic currents. Again, a large modification
    in the great antarctic drift-current would in like manner affect all
    the currents of the Pacific. On the other hand, any great change in
    the currents of the Pacific would ultimately affect the currents of
    the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, through its influence on the Cape Horn
    current, the South Australian current, and the current passing through
    the Asiatic archipelago; and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, any changes in the currents
    of the Atlantic or Indian Oceans would modify the currents of the
    Pacific.</p>

  <p><em>Cause of Gibraltar Current.</em>—I may now consider the cause of the
    Gibraltar current. There can be little doubt that this current owes its
    origin (as Mr. Laughton points out) to the Gulf-stream. “I conceive,”
    that author remarks, “that the Gibraltar current is distinctly a stream
    formed by easterly drift of the North Atlantic, which, although it
    forms a southerly current on the coast of Portugal, is still strongly
    pressed to the eastward and seeks the first escape it can find. So
    great indeed does this pressure seem to be, that more water is forced
    through the Straits than the Mediterranean can receive, and a part
    of it is ejected in reverse currents, some as lateral currents on
    the surface, some, it appears, as an under current at a considerable
    depth.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The funnel-shaped nature of the strait through which the
    water is impelled helps to explain the existence of the under current.
    The water being pressed into the narrow neck of the channel tends to
    produce a slight banking up; and as the pressure urging the water
    forward is greatest at the surface and diminishes rapidly downwards,
    the tendency to the restoration of level will cause an underflow
    towards the Atlantic, because below the surface the water will find the
    path of least resistance. It is evident indeed that this underflow will
    not take place toward the Mediterranean, from the fact that that sea is
    already filled to overflowing by the current received from the outside
    ocean.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

  <p>If we examine the Current-chart published by the Hydrographic
    Department of the Admiralty, we shall find the Gibraltar current
    represented as merely a continuation of the S.E. flow of Gulf-stream
    water. Now, if the arrows shown upon this chart indicate correctly the
    direction of the flow, we must become convinced that the Gulf-stream
    water cannot possibly avoid passing through the Gibraltar Strait. Of
    course the excess of evaporation over that of precipitation within
    the Mediterranean area would alone suffice to produce a considerable
    current through the Strait; but this of itself would not fill that
    inland sea to overflowing.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

  <p>The Atlantic may, in fact, be regarded as an immense whirlpool with the
    Saragossa Sea as its vortex; and although it is true, as will be seen
    from an inspection of the Chart, that the wind blows round the Atlantic
    along the very path taken by the water, impelling the water forward
    along every inch of its course, yet nevertheless it must hold equally
    true that the water has a tendency to flow off in a straight line at
    a tangent to the circular course in which it is moving. But the water
    is so hemmed in on all sides that it cannot leave this circular path
    except only at two points; and at these two points it actually does
    flow outwards. On the east and west sides the land prevents any such
    outflow. Similarly, in the south the escape of the water is frustrated
    by the pressure of the opposing currents flowing from that quarter;
    while in the north it is prevented by the pressure exerted by polar
    currents from Davis Strait and the Arctic Ocean. But in the Strait of
    Gibraltar and in the north-eastern portion of the Atlantic between
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>Iceland and the north-eastern shores of Europe there is no resistance
    offered: and at these two points an outflow does actually take place.
    In both cases, however, especially the latter, the outflow is greatly
    aided by the impulse of the prevailing winds.</p>

  <p>No one, who will glance at the accompanying chart (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I.</a>) showing
    how the north-eastern branch of the Gulf-stream bends round and, of
    course, necessarily presses against the coast, can fail to understand
    how the Atlantic water should be impelled into the Gibraltar Strait,
    even although the loss sustained by the Mediterranean from evaporation
    did not exceed the gain from rain and rivers.</p>

  <p><em>Theory of Under Currents.</em>—The consideration that ocean-currents are
    simply parts of a system of circulation produced by the system of
    prevailing winds, and not by the impulse of the trade-winds alone,
    helps to remove the difficulty which some have in accounting for the
    existence of under currents without referring them to difference of
    specific gravity. Take the case of the Gulf-stream, which passes
    under the polar stream on the west of Spitzbergen, this latter stream
    passing in turn under the Gulf-stream a little beyond Bear Island. The
    polar streams have their origin in the region of prevailing northerly
    winds, which no doubt extends to the pole. The current flowing past
    the western shores of Spitzbergen, throughout its entire course up
    to near the point where it disappears under the warm waters of the
    Gulf-stream, lies in the region of these same northerly winds. Now why
    should this current cease to be a surface current as soon as it passes
    out of the region of northerly into that of south-westerly winds? The
    explanation seems to be this: when the stream enters the region of
    prevailing south-westerly winds, its progress southwards along the
    surface of the ocean is retarded both by the wind and by the surface
    water moving in opposition to its course; but being continually pressed
    forward by the impulse of the northerly winds acting along its whole
    course back almost to the pole, perhaps, or as far north at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> as
    the sea is not wholly covered with ice, the polar current cannot stop
    when it enters the region of opposing winds and currents; it must move
    forward. But the water thus pressed from behind will naturally take
    the <em>path of least resistance</em>. Now in the present case this path will
    necessarily lie at a considerable distance below the surface. Had the
    polar stream simply to contend with the Gulf-stream flowing in the
    opposite direction, it would probably keep the surface and continue its
    course along the side of that stream; but it is opposed by the winds,
    from which it cannot escape except by dipping down under the surface;
    and the depth to which it will descend will depend upon the depth of
    the surface current flowing in the opposite direction. There is no
    necessity for supposing a heaping up of the water in order to produce
    by pressure a force sufficient to impel the under current. The pressure
    of the water from behind is of itself enough. The same explanation, of
    course, applies to the case of the Gulf-stream passing under the polar
    stream. And if we reflect that these under currents are but parts of
    the general system of circulation, and that in most cases they are
    currents compensating for water drained off at some other quarter, we
    need not wonder at the distance which they may in some cases flow, as,
    for example, from the banks of Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico.
    The under currents of the Gulf-stream are necessary to compensate for
    the water impelled southwards by the northerly winds; and again, the
    polar under currents are necessary to compensate for the water impelled
    northward by the south and south-westerly winds.</p>

  <p>But it may be asked, how do the opposing currents succeed in crossing
    each other? It is evident that the Gulf-stream must plunge through
    the whole thickness of the polar stream before it can become an
    under current, and so likewise must the cold water of the polar-flow
    pass through the genial water of the Gulf-stream in order to get
    underneath it and continue on its course towards the south. The
    accompanying diagram (Plate II., Fig. 1) will render this sufficiently
    intelligible.</p>

  <p>Now these two great ocean-currents are so compelled to intersect each
    other for the simple reason that they cannot turn aside, the one to the
    left and the other to the right. When two broad streams like those in
    question are pressed up against each other, they succeed in mutually
    intersecting each other’s path by breaking up into bands or belts—the
    cold water being invaded and pierced as it were by long tongues of
    warm water, while at the same time the latter is similarly intersected
    by corresponding protrusions of cold water. The two streams become
    in a manner interlocked, and the one passes through the other very
    much as we pass the fingers of one hand between the fingers of the
    other. The diagram (<a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II.</a>, Fig. 2), representing the surface of
    the ocean at the place of meeting of two opposing currents, will show
    this better than description. At the surface the bands necessarily
    assume the tongue-shaped appearance represented in the diagram, but
    when they have succeeded in mutually passing down through the whole
    thickness of the opposing currents, they then unite and form two
    definite under currents, flowing in opposite directions. The polar
    bands, after penetrating the Gulf-stream, unite below to form a
    southward-flowing under current, and in the same way the Gulf-stream
    bands, uniting underneath the polar current, continue in their
    northerly course as a broad under current of warm water. That this is
    a correct representation of what actually occurs in nature becomes
    evident from an inspection of the current charts. Thus in the chart
    of the North Atlantic which accompanies Dr. Petermann’s Memoir on the
    Gulf-stream, we observe that south of Spitzbergen the polar current and
    the Gulf-stream are mutually interpenetrated—long tongues invading and
    dipping down underneath the Gulf-stream, while in like manner the polar
    current becomes similarly intersected by well-marked protrusions of
    warm water flowing from the south. (See <a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II.</a>, Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>No accurate observations, as far as I know, have been made regarding
    the amount of work performed by the wind in impelling the water
    forward; but when we consider the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> retarding effect of objects
    on the earth’s surface, it is quite apparent that the amount of work
    performed on the surface of the ocean must be far greater than is
    generally supposed. For example, Mr. Buchan, Secretary to the Scottish
    Meteorological Society, has shown<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that a fence made of slabs of
    wood three inches in width and three inches apart from each other is a
    protection even during high winds to objects on the lee side of it, and
    that a wire screen with meshes about an inch apart affords protection
    during a gale to flower-pots. The same writer was informed by Mr. Addie
    that such a screen put up at Rockville was torn to pieces by a storm of
    wind, the wire screen giving way much in the same way as sails during a
    hurricane at sea.</p>

  <p><em>The “Challenger’s” Crucial Test of the Wind and Gravitation Theories
    of Oceanic Circulation.</em>—It has been shown in former chapters that all
    the facts which have been adduced in support of the gravitation theory
    are equally well explained by the wind theory. We may now consider a
    class of facts which do not appear to harmonize with either theory. The
    recent investigations of the <cite>Challenger</cite> Expedition into the thermal
    state of the ocean reveal a condition of things which appears to me
    utterly irreconcilable with the gravitation theory.</p>

  <p>It is a condition absolutely essential to the gravitation theory that
    the surface of the ocean should be highest in equatorial regions and
    slope downwards to either pole. Were water absolutely frictionless, an
    incline, however small, would be sufficient to produce a surface-flow
    from the equator to the poles, but to induce such an effect some slope
    there must be, or gravitation could exercise no power in drawing the
    surface-water polewards.</p>

  <p>The researches of the <cite>Challenger</cite> Expedition bring to light the
    striking and important fact that the general surface of the North
    Atlantic in order to produce equilibrium must stand at a higher level
    than at the equator. In other words the surface of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>the Atlantic is
    lowest at the equator, and rises with a gentle slope to well-nigh the
    latitude of England. If this be the case, then it is mechanically
    impossible that, as far as the North Atlantic is concerned, there can
    be any such general movement as Dr. Carpenter believes. Gravitation can
    no more cause the surface-water of the Atlantic to flow towards the
    arctic regions than it can compel the waters of the Gulf of Mexico up
    the Mississippi into the Missouri. The impossibility is equally great
    in both cases.</p>

  <p>In order to prove what has been stated, let us take a section of the
    mid-Atlantic, north and south, across the equator; and, to give the
    gravitation theory every advantage, let us select that particular
    section adopted by Dr. Carpenter as the one of all others most
    favourable to his theory, viz., Section marked No. VIII. in his memoir
    lately read before the Royal Geographical Society.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

  <p>The fact that the polar cold water comes so near the surface at the
    equator is regarded by Dr. Carpenter as evidence in favour of the
    gravitation theory. On first looking at Dr. Carpenter’s section it
    forcibly struck me that if it was accurately drawn, the ocean to be
    in equilibrium would require to stand at a higher level in the North
    Atlantic than at the equator. In order, therefore, to determine
    whether this is the case or not I asked the hydrographer of the
    Admiralty to favour me with the temperature soundings indicated in the
    section, a favour which was most obligingly granted. The following
    are the temperature soundings at the three stations A, B, and C. The
    temperature of C are the mean of six soundings taken along near the
    equator:—</p>

  <p>On computing the extent to which the three columns A, B, and C are each
    expanded by heat according to Muncke’s table of the expansion of sea
    water for every degree Fahrenheit, I found that column B, in order to
    be in equilibrium with C (the equatorial column), would require to have
    its surface standing fully 2 feet 6 inches above the level of column C,
    and column A fully 3 feet 6 inches above that column. In short, it is
    evident that there must be a gradual rise from the equator to latitude
    38° N. of 3½ feet. Any one can verify the accuracy of these results by
    making the necessary computations for himself.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

  <p>I may observe that, had column C extended to the same depth as columns
    A and B, the difference of level would be considerably greater, for
    column C requires to balance only that portion of columns A and B
    which lies above the level of its base. Suppose a depth of ocean equal
    to that of column C to extend to the north pole, and the polar water
    to have a uniform temperature of 32° from the surface to the bottom,
    then, in order to produce equilibrium, the surface of the ocean at
    the equator would require to be 4 feet 6 inches above that at the
    pole. But the surface of the ocean at B would be 7 feet, and at A 8
    feet, above the poles. Gravitation never could have caused the ocean
    to assume this form. It is impossible that this immense mass of warm
    water, extending to such a depth in the North Atlantic, could have been
    brought from equatorial regions by means of gravitation. And, even
    if we suppose this accumulation of warm water can be accounted for
    by some other means, still its presence precludes the possibility of
    any such surface-flow as that advocated by Dr. Carpenter. For so long
    as the North Atlantic stands 3½ feet above the level of the equator,
    gravitation can never move the equatorial waters polewards.</p>

  <p>There is another feature of this section irreconcilable with the
    gravitation theory. It will be observed that the accumulation of warm
    water is all in the North Atlantic, and that there is little or none
    in the south. But according to the gravitation theory it ought to
    have been the reverse. For owing to the unrestricted communication
    between the equatorial and antarctic regions, the general flow of
    water towards the south pole is, according to that theory, supposed to
    be greater than towards the north, and consequently the quantity of
    warm equatorial water in the South Atlantic ought also to be greater.
    Dr. Carpenter himself seems to be aware of this difficulty besetting
    the theory, and meets it by stating that “the upper stratum of the
    North Atlantic is not nearly as much cooled down by its limited polar
    underflow, as that of the South Atlantic is by the vast movement of
    antarctic water which is constantly taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> place towards the equator.”
    But this “vast movement of antarctic water” necessarily implies a vast
    counter-movement of warm surface-water. So that if there is more polar
    water in the South Atlantic to produce the cooling effect, there should
    likewise be more warm water to be cooled.</p>

  <p>According to the wind theory of oceanic circulation the explanation of
    the whole phenomena is simple and obvious. It has already been shown
    that owing to the fact that the S. E. trades are stronger than the N.
    E., and blow constantly over upon the northern hemisphere, the warm
    surface-water of the South Atlantic is drifted across the equator. It
    is then carried by the equatorial current into the Gulf of Mexico, and
    afterwards of course forms a part of the Gulf-stream.</p>

  <p>The North Atlantic, on the other hand, not only does not lose its
    surface heat like the equatorial and South Atlantic, but it receives
    from the Gulf-stream in the form of warm water an amount of heat, as we
    have seen, equal to one-fourth of all the heat which it receives from
    the sun. The reason why the warm surface strata are so much thicker
    on the North Atlantic than on the equatorial regions is perfectly
    obvious. The surface-water at the equator is swept into the Gulf of
    Mexico by the trade-winds and the equatorial current, as rapidly as it
    is heated by the sun, so that it has not time to gather to any great
    depth. But all this warm water is carried by the Gulf-stream into the
    North Atlantic, where it accumulates. That this great depth of warm
    water in the North Atlantic, represented in the section, is derived
    from the Gulf-stream, and not from a direct flow from the equator due
    to gravitation, is further evident from the fact that temperature
    sounding A in latitude 38° N. is made through that immense body of warm
    water, upwards of 300 fathoms thick, extending from Bermuda to near the
    Azores, discovered by the <cite>Challenger</cite> Expedition, and justly regarded
    by Captain Nares as an offshoot of the Gulf-stream. This, in Captain
    Nares’s Report, is No. 8 “temperature sounding,” between Bermuda and
    the Azores; sounding <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>B is No. 6 “temperature curve,” between Teneriffe
    and St. Thomas.</p>

  <p>There is an additional reason to the one already stated why the
    surface temperature of the South Atlantic should be so much below
    that of the North. It is perfectly true that whatever amount of water
    is transferred from the southern hemisphere to the northern must be
    compensated by an equal amount from the northern to the southern
    hemisphere, nevertheless the warm water which is carried off the South
    Atlantic by the winds is not directly compensated by water from the
    north, but by that cold antarctic current whose existence is so well
    known to mariners from the immense masses of ice which it brings from
    the Southern Ocean.</p>

  <p><em>Thermal Condition of Southern Ocean.</em>——The thermal condition of the
    Southern Ocean, as ascertained by the <cite>Challenger</cite> Expedition, appears
    to me to be also irreconcilable with the gravitation theory. Between
    the parallels of latitude 65° 42′ S. and 50° 1′ S., the ocean, with
    the exception of a thin stratum at the surface heated by the sun’s
    rays, was found, down to the depth of about 200 fathoms, to be several
    degrees colder than the water underneath.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The cold upper stratum
    is evidently an antarctic current, and the warm underlying water an
    equatorial under current. But, according to the gravitation theory, the
    colder water should be underneath.</p>

  <p>The very fact of a mass of water, 200 fathoms deep and extending over
    fifteen degrees of latitude, remaining above water of three or four
    degrees higher temperature shows how little influence difference of
    temperature has in producing motion. If it had the potency which some
    attribute to it, one would suppose that this cold stratum should sink
    down and displace the warm water underneath. If difference of density
    is sufficient to move the water horizontally, surely it must be more
    than sufficient to cause it to sink vertically.</p>

    the bearing which these points have on the grand question of secular
    changes of climate during geological epochs, more particularly in
    reference to that mystery the cause of the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>In concluding this discussion regarding oceanic circulation, I may
    therefore be allowed briefly to recapitulate those points connected
    with the subject which seem to shed most light on the question of
    changes of climate.</p>

  <p>The complete agreement between the systems of ocean-currents and
    winds not only shows that the winds are the impelling cause of the
    currents, but it also indicates to what an extent the <em>directions</em> of
    the currents are determined by the winds, or, more properly, to what an
    extent their directions are determined by the <em>direction</em> of the winds.</p>

  <p>We have seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> to what an enormous extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> the climatic
    conditions of the globe are dependent on the distribution of heat
    effected by means of ocean-currents. It has been there pointed out
    that, if the heat conveyed from inter-tropical to temperate and polar
    regions by oceanic circulation were restored to the former, the
    equatorial regions would then have a temperature about 55° warmer,
    and the high polar regions a climate 83° colder than at present. It
    follows, therefore, that any cause which will greatly affect the
    currents or greatly change their paths and mode of distribution, will
    of necessity seriously affect the climatic condition of the globe. But
    as the existence of these currents depends on the winds, and their
    direction and form of distribution depend upon the direction and form
    of distribution of the winds, any cause which will greatly affect the
    winds will also greatly affect the currents, and consequently will
    influence the climatic condition of the globe. Again, as the existence
    of the winds depends mainly on the difference of temperature between
    equatorial and polar regions, any cause which will greatly affect this
    difference of temperature will likewise greatly affect the winds; and
    these will just as surely react on the currents and climatic conditions
    of the globe. A simple increase or decrease in the difference of
    temperature between equatorial and polar regions, though it would
    certainly produce an increase or a decrease, as the case might be, in
    the strength of the winds, and consequently in the strength of the
    currents, would not, however, greatly affect the mode of <em>distribution</em>
    of the winds, nor, as a consequence, the mode of <em>distribution</em> of
    the currents. But although a simple change in the difference of
    temperature between the equator and the poles would not produce a
    different <em>distribution</em> of aërial, and consequently of ocean-currents,
    nevertheless a <em>difference in the difference</em> of temperature between
    the equator and the two poles would do so; that is to say, any cause
    that should increase the difference of temperature between the equator
    and the pole on the one hemisphere, and decrease that difference on
    the other, would effect a change in the distribution of the aërial
    currents, which change would in turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> produce a corresponding change in
    the distribution of ocean-currents.</p>

  <p>It has been shown<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> that an increase in the eccentricity of the
    earth’s orbit tends to lower the temperature of the one hemisphere and
    to raise the temperature of the other. It is true that an increase of
    eccentricity does not afford more heat to the one hemisphere than to
    the other; nevertheless it brings about a condition of things which
    tends to lower the temperature of the one hemisphere and to raise the
    temperature of the other. Let us imagine the eccentricity to be at its
    superior limit, 0·07775, and the winter solstice in the aphelion. The
    midwinter temperature, owing to the increased distance of the sun,
    would be lowered enormously; and the effect of this would be to cause
    all the moisture which now falls as rain during winter in temperate
    regions to fall as snow. Nor is this all; the winters would not merely
    be colder than now, but they would also be much longer. At present the
    summer half-year exceeds the winter half year by nearly eight days; but
    at the period in question the winters would be longer than the summers
    by upwards of thirty-six days. The heat of the sun during the short
    summer, for reasons which have already been explained, would not be
    sufficient to melt the snow of winter; so that gradually, year by year,
    the snow would continue to accumulate on the ground.</p>

  <p>On the southern hemisphere the opposite condition of things would
    obtain. Owing to the nearness of the sun during the winter of that
    hemisphere, the moisture of the air would be precipitated as rain in
    regions where at present it falls as snow. This and the shortness of
    the winter would tend to produce a decrease in the quantity of snow.
    The difference of temperature between the equatorial and the temperate
    and polar regions would therefore be greater on the northern than on
    the southern hemisphere; and, as a consequence, the aërial currents
    of the former hemisphere would be stronger than those of the latter.
    This would be more especially the case <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>with the trade-winds. The
    N.E. trades being stronger than the S.E. trades would blow across the
    equator, and the median line between them would therefore be at some
    distance to the south of the equator. Thus the equatorial waters would
    be impelled more to the southern than to the northern hemisphere; and
    the warm water carried over in this manner to the southern hemisphere
    would tend to increase the difference of temperature between the two
    hemispheres. This change, again, would in turn tend to strengthen the
    N.E. and to weaken the S.E. trades, and would thus induce a still
    greater flow of equatorial waters into the southern hemisphere—a
    result which would still more increase the difference of temperature
    between the northern and southern hemisphere, and so on—the one cause
    so reacting on the other as to increase its effects, as was shown at
    length in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a></p>

  <p>It was this mutual reaction of those physical agents which led, as was
    pointed out in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>, to that extraordinary condition of climate
    which prevailed during the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>There is another circumstance to be considered which perhaps more
    than any thing else would tend to lower the temperature of the one
    hemisphere and to raise the temperature of the other; and this is
    the <em>displacement of the great equatorial current</em>. During a glacial
    period in the northern hemisphere the median line between the trades
    would be shifted very considerably south of the equator; and the same
    would necessarily be the case with the great equatorial currents, the
    only difference being that the equatorial currents, other things being
    equal, would be deflected farther south than the median line. For the
    water impelled by the strong N.E. trades would be moving with greater
    velocity than the waters impelled by the weaker S.E. trades, and, of
    course, would cross the median line of the trades before its progress
    southwards could be arrested by the counteracting influence of the S.E.
    trades. Let us glance briefly at the results which would follow from
    such a condition of things. In the first place, as was shown on former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
    occasions,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> were the equatorial current of the Atlantic (the feeder
    of the Gulf-stream) shifted considerably south of its present position,
    it would not bifurcate, as it now does, off Cape St. Roque, owing to
    the fact that the whole of the waters would strike obliquely against
    the Brazilian coast and thus be deflected into the Southern Ocean. The
    effect produced on the climate of the North Atlantic and North-Western
    Europe by the withdrawal of the water forming the Gulf-stream, may be
    conceived from what has already been stated concerning the amount of
    heat conveyed by that stream. The heat thus withdrawn from the North
    Atlantic would go to raise the temperature of the Southern Ocean and
    antarctic regions. A similar result would take place in the Pacific
    Ocean. Were the equatorial current of that ocean removed greatly to
    the south of its present position, it would not then impinge and be
    deflected upon the Asiatic coast, but upon the continent of Australia;
    and the greater portion of its waters would then pass southward into
    the Southern Ocean, while that portion passing round the north of
    Australia (owing to the great strength of the N.E. trades) would rather
    flow into the Indian Ocean than turn round, as now, along the east
    coast of Asia by the Japan Islands. The stoppage of the Japan current,
    combined with the displacement of the equatorial current to the south
    of the equator, would greatly lower the temperature of the whole of the
    North Pacific and adjoining continents, and raise to a corresponding
    degree the temperature of the South Pacific and Southern Ocean. Again,
    the waters of the equatorial current of the Indian Ocean (owing to the
    opposing N.E. trades), would not, as at present, find their way round
    the Cape of Good Hope into the North Atlantic, but would be deflected
    southwards into the Antarctic Sea.</p>

  <p>We have in the present state of things a striking example of the extent
    to which the median line between the two trades may be shifted, and the
    position of the great equatorial currents of the ocean may be affected,
    by a slight difference in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>relative strength of the two aërial
    currents. The S.E. trades are at present a little stronger than the
    N.E.; and the consequence is that they blow across the equator into the
    northern hemisphere to a distance sometimes of 10 or 15°, so that the
    mean position of the median line lies at least 6 or 7 degrees north of
    the equator.</p>

  <p>And it is doubtless owing to the superior strength of the S.E. trades
    that so much warm water crosses the equator from the South to the North
    Atlantic, and that the main portion of the equatorial current flows
    into the Caribbean Sea rather than along the Brazilian coast. Were the
    two trades of equal strength, the transference of heat into the North
    Atlantic from the southern hemisphere by means of the Southern Atlantic
    and equatorial currents would be much less than at present. The same
    would also hold true in regard to the Pacific.</p>

  <p><em>Ocean-currents in Relation to the Distribution of Plants and
    Animals.</em>—In the fifth and last editions of the “Origin of Species,”
    Mr. Darwin has done me the honour to express his belief that the
    foregoing view regarding alternate cold and warm periods in north
    and south during the glacial epoch explains a great many facts in
    connection with the distribution of plants and animals which have
    always been regarded as exceedingly puzzling.</p>

  <p>There are certain species of plants which occur alike in the temperate
    regions of the southern and northern hemispheres. At the equator these
    same temperate forms are found on elevated mountains, but not on the
    lowlands. How, then, did these temperate forms manage to cross the
    equator from the northern temperate regions to the southern, and <i lang="la">vice
    versâ</i>? Mr. Darwin’s solution of the problem is (in his own words) as
    follows:—</p>

  <p>“As the cold became more and more intense, we know that arctic forms
    invaded the temperate regions; and from the facts just given, there
    can hardly be a doubt that some of the more vigorous, dominant, and
    widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the equatorial lowlands.
    The inhabitants of these hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> lowlands would at the same time have
    migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the south; for the
    southern hemisphere was at this period warmer. On the decline of the
    glacial period, as both hemispheres gradually recovered their former
    temperatures, the northern temperate forms living on the lowlands under
    the equator would have been driven to their former homes or have been
    destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning from the
    south. Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would almost
    certainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if sufficiently
    lofty, they would have long survived like the arctic forms on the
    mountains of Europe.”</p>

  <p>“In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in
    its turn be subjected to a severe glacial period, with the northern
    hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms
    would invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had
    before been left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the
    southern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would return
    to their former homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and
    carrying southward with them some of the northern temperate forms which
    had descended from their mountain fastnesses. Thus we should have some
    few species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate
    zones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions” (p.
    339, sixth edition).</p>

  <p>Additional light is cast on this subject by the results already stated
    in regard to the enormous extent to which the temperature of the
    equator is affected by ocean-currents. Were there no transferrence of
    heat from equatorial to temperate and polar regions, the temperature
    of the equator, as has been remarked, would probably be about 55°
    warmer than at present. In such a case no plant existing on the face of
    the globe could live at the equator unless on some elevated mountain
    region. On the other hand, were the quantity of warm water which is
    being transferred from the equator to be very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> much increased, the
    temperature of inter-tropical latitudes might be so lowered as easily
    to admit of temperate species of plants growing at the equator. A
    lowering of the temperature at the equator some 20° or 30° is all that
    would be required; and only a moderate increase in the volume of the
    currents proceeding from the equator, taken in connection with the
    effects flowing from the following considerations, might suffice to
    produce that result. During the glacial epoch, when the one hemisphere
    was under ice and the other enjoying a warm and equable climate, the
    median line between the trades may have been shifted to almost the
    tropical line of the warm hemisphere. Under such a condition of things
    the warmest part would probably be somewhere about the tropic of the
    warm hemisphere, and not, as now, at the equator; for since all, or
    nearly all, the surface-water of the equator would then be impelled
    over to the warm hemisphere, the tropical regions of that hemisphere
    would be receiving nearly double their present amount of warm water.</p>

  <p>Again, as the equatorial current at this time would be shifted towards
    the tropic of the warm hemisphere, the surface-water would not, as at
    present, be flowing in equatorial regions parallel to the equator,
    but obliquely across it from the cold to the warm hemisphere. This of
    itself would tend greatly to lower the temperature of the equator.</p>

  <p>It follows, therefore, as a necessary consequence, that during the
    glacial epoch, when the one hemisphere was under snow and ice and
    the other enjoying a warm and equable climate, the temperature of
    the equator would be lower than at present. But when the glaciated
    hemisphere (which we may assume to be the northern) began to grow
    warmer and the climate of the southern or warm hemisphere to get
    colder, the median line of the trades and the equatorial currents
    of the ocean also would begin to move back from the southern tropic
    towards the equator. This would cause the temperature of the equator
    to rise and to continue rising until the equatorial currents reached
    their normal position. When the snow began to accumulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> on the
    southern hemisphere and to disappear on the northern, the median line
    of the trades and the equatorial currents of the ocean would then
    begin to move towards the northern tropic as they had formerly towards
    the southern. The temperature of the equator would then again begin
    to sink, and continue to do so until the glaciation of the southern
    hemisphere reached its maximum. This oscillation of the thermal equator
    to and fro across the geographical equator would continue so long as
    the alternate glaciation of the two hemispheres continued.</p>

  <p>This lowering of the temperature of the equator during the severest
    part of the glacial epoch will help to explain the former existence of
    glaciers in inter-tropical regions at no very great elevation above the
    sea-level, evidence of which appears recently to have been found by
    Professor Agassiz, Mr. Belt, and others.</p>

  <p>The glacial <em>epoch</em> may be considered as contemporaneous in both
    hemispheres. But the epoch consisted of a succession of cold and warm
    <em>periods</em>, the cold periods of one hemisphere coinciding with the warm
    periods of the other, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p><em>Migration across the Equator.</em>—Mr. Belt<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and others have felt
    some difficulty in understanding how, according to theory, the plants
    and animals of temperate regions could manage to migrate from one
    hemisphere to the other, seeing that in their passage they would have
    to cross the thermal equator. The oscillation to and fro of the thermal
    equator across the geographical, removes every difficulty in regard to
    how the migration takes place. When, for example, a cold period on the
    northern hemisphere and the corresponding warm one on the southern were
    at their maximum, the thermal equator would by this time have probably
    passed beyond the Tropic of Capricorn. The geographical equator would
    then be enjoying a subtropical, if not a temperate condition of
    climate, and the plants and animals of the northern hemisphere would
    manage then to reach the equator. When the cold began to abate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>on
    the northern and to increase on the southern hemisphere, the thermal
    equator would commence its retreat towards the geographical. The plants
    and animals from the north, in order to escape the increasing heat as
    the thermal equator approached them, would begin to ascend the mountain
    heights; and when that equator had passed to its northern limit, and
    the geographical equator was again enjoying a subtropical condition of
    climate, the plants and animals would begin to descend and pursue their
    journey southwards as the cold abated on the southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p><em>Alternate Cold and Warm Periods.</em>—If the theory developed in the
    foregoing chapters in reference to the cause of secular changes of
    climate be correct, it follows that that long age known as the glacial
    epoch did not, as has hitherto been generally supposed, consist of one
    long unbroken period of cold and ice. Neither did it consist, as some
    have concluded, of two long periods of ice with an intervening mild
    period, but it must have consisted of a long succession of cold and
    warm periods; the warm periods of the one hemisphere corresponding in
    time with the cold periods of the other and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. It follows
    also from theory that as the cold periods became more and more severe,
    the warm intervening periods would become more and more warm and
    equable. As the ice began to accumulate during the cold periods in
    subarctic and temperate regions in places where it previously did not
    exist, so in like manner during the corresponding warm periods it would
    begin to disappear in arctic regions where it had held enduring sway
    throughout the now closing cycle. As the cold periods in the southern
    hemisphere became more and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span> severe, the ice would continue to
    advance northwards in the temperate regions; but at that very same
    time the intervening warm periods in the northern hemisphere would
    become warmer and warmer and more equable, and the ice of the arctic
    regions would continue to disappear farther and farther to the north,
    till by the time that the ice had reached a maximum during the cold
    antarctic periods, Greenland and the arctic regions would, during the
    warm intervening periods, be probably free of ice and enjoying a mild
    and equable climate. Or we may say that as the one hemisphere became
    cold the other became warm, and when the cold reached a maximum in the
    one hemisphere, the warmth would reach a maximum in the other. The time
    when the ice had reached its greatest extension on the one hemisphere
    would be the time when it had disappeared from the other.</p>

  <p><em>Inter-glacial Periods a Test of Theories.</em>—Here we have the grand
    crucial test of the truth of the foregoing theory of the cause of
    the glacial epoch. That the glacial epoch should have consisted of a
    succession of cold and warm periods is utterly inconsistent with all
    previous theories which have been advanced to account for it. What,
    then, is the evidence of geology on this subject? If the glacial epoch
    can be proved from geological evidence to have consisted of such a
    succession of cold and warm periods, then I have little doubt but the
    theory will soon be generally accepted. But at the very outset an
    objection meets us, viz., why call an epoch, which consisted as much of
    warm periods as of cold, a glacial epoch, or an “Ice Age,” as Mr. James
    Geikie tersely expresses it? Why not as well call it a warm epoch as a
    cold one, seeing that, according to theory, it was just as much a warm
    as a cold epoch? The answer to this objection will be fully discussed
    in the chapter on the Reason of the Imperfection of Geological Records.
    But in the meantime, I may remark that it will be shown that the epoch
    known as the glacial has been justly called the glacial epoch or “Ice
    Age,” because the geological evidences of the cold periods remain in
    a remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> perfect state, whilst the evidences of the warm periods
    have to a great extent disappeared. The reason of this difference
    in the two cases will be discussed in the chapter to which I have
    referred. Besides, the condition of things during the cold periods was
    so extraordinary, so exceptional, so totally different from those now
    prevailing, that even supposing the geological records of the warm
    periods had been as well preserved as those of the cold, nevertheless
    we should have termed the epoch in question a glacial epoch. There
    is yet another reason, however, for our limited knowledge of warm
    inter-glacial periods. Till very lately, little or no attention was
    paid by geologists to this part of the subject in the way of keeping
    records of cases of inter-glacial deposits which, from time to time,
    have been observed. Few geologists ever dreamt of such a thing as
    warm periods during the age of ice, so that when intercalated beds of
    sand and gravel, beds of peat, roots, branches, trunks, leaves, and
    fruits of trees were found in the boulder clay, no physical importance
    was attached to them, and consequently no description or record of
    them ever kept. In fact, all such examples were regarded as purely
    accidental and exceptional, and were considered not worthy of any
    special attention. A case which came under my own observation will
    illustrate my meaning. An intelligent geologist, some years ago, read a
    paper before one of our local geological societies, giving an account
    of a fossiliferous bed of clay found intercalated between two distinct
    beds of till. In this intercalated bed were found rootlets and stems of
    trees, nuts, and other remains, showing that it had evidently been an
    old inter-glacial land surface. In the transactions of the society a
    description of the two beds of till was given, but no mention whatever
    was made of the intercalated bed containing the organic remains,
    although this was the only point of any real importance.</p>

  <p>Since the theory that the glacial epoch resulted from a high state
    of eccentricity of the earth’s orbit began to receive some little
    acceptance, geologists have paid a good deal of attention to cases of
    intercalated beds in the till containing organic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> remains, and the
    result is that we have already a great body of evidence of a geological
    nature in favour of warm inter-glacial periods, and I have little
    doubt that in the course of a few years the former occurrence of warm
    inter-glacial periods will be universally admitted.</p>

  <p>I shall now proceed to give a very brief outline of the evidence
    bearing on the subject. But the cases to which I shall have to refer
    are much too numerous to allow me to enter into details.</p>

  <p><em>Inter-glacial Beds of Switzerland.</em>—The first geologist, so far as I
    am aware, who directed attention to evidence of a break in the cold of
    the glacial epoch was M. Morlot. It is now twenty years ago since he
    announced the existence of a warm period during the glacial epoch from
    geological evidence connected with the glacial drift of the Alps.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

  <p>The rivers of Switzerland, he found, show on their banks three
    well-marked terraces of regularly stratified and well-rounded shingle,
    identical with the modern deposits of the rivers. They stand at 50,
    100, and 150 feet above the present level of the rivers. These terraces
    were evidently formed by the present system of rivers when these flowed
    at a higher level, and extend up the Alps to a height of from 3,000 to
    4,000 feet above the level of the sea. There is a terrace bordering the
    Rhine at Camischollas, above Disentis, 4,400 feet above the level of
    the sea, proving that during the period of its formation the Alps were
    free of ice up to the height of 4,400 feet above the sea-level. It is
    well known that a glacial period must have succeeded the formation of
    these drifts, for they are in many places covered with erratics. At
    Geneva, for example, an erratic drift nearly 50 feet thick is seen to
    rest on the drift of the middle terrace, which rises 100 feet above the
    level of the lake. But it is also evident that a glacial period must
    have preceded the formation of the drift beds, for they are found to
    lie in many places upon the unstratified boulder <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>clay or <em>till</em>. M.
    Morlot observed in the neighbourhood of Clareus, from 7 to 9 feet of
    drift resting upon a bed of true till 40 feet thick; the latter was
    composed of a compact blue clay, containing worn and scratched alpine
    boulders and without any trace of stratification. In the gorge of
    Dranse, near Thoron, M. Morlot found the whole three formations in a
    direct superimposed series. At the bottom was a mass of compact till or
    boulder clay, 12 feet thick, containing boulders of alpine limestone.
    Over this mass came regularly stratified beds 150 feet thick, made
    up of rounded pebbles in horizontal beds. Above this again lay a
    second formation of unstratified boulder clay, with erratic blocks and
    striated pebbles, which constituted the left lateral moraine of the
    great glacier of the Rhone, when it advanced for the second time to the
    Lake of Geneva. A condition of things somewhat similar was observed by
    M. Ischer in the neighbourhood of Berne.</p>

  <p>These facts, M. Morlot justly considers, prove the existence of two
    glacial periods separated by an intermediate one, during which the
    ice, which had not only covered Switzerland, but the greater part of
    Europe, disappeared even in the principal valleys of the Alps to a
    height of more than 4,400 feet above the present level of the sea. This
    warm period, after continuing for long ages, was succeeded by a second
    glacial period, during which the country was again covered with ice as
    before. M. Morlot even suggests the possibility of these alternations
    of cold and warm periods depending upon a cosmical cause. “Wild as it
    may have appeared,” he says, “when first started, the idea of general
    and periodical eras of refrigeration for our planet, connected perhaps
    with some cosmic agency, may eventually prove correct.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards, evidence of a far more remarkable character was
    found in the glacial drift of Switzerland, namely, the famous lignite
    beds of Dürnten. In the vicinity of Utznach and Dürnten, on the Lake of
    Zurich, and near Mörschwyl, on the Lake of Constance, there are beds of
    coal or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>lignite, nearly 12 feet thick, lying directly on the boulder
    clay. Overlying these beds is another mass of drift and clay 30 feet
    in thickness, with rounded blocks, and on the top of this upper drift
    lie long angular erratics, which evidently have been transported on
    the back of glaciers.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Professor Vogt attributes their transport
    to floating ice; but he evidently does so to avoid the hypothesis of a
    warm period during the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>Here we have proof not merely of the disappearance of the ice during
    the glacial epoch, but of its absence during a period of sufficient
    length to allow of the growth of 10 or 12 feet of coal. Professor Heer
    thinks that this coal-bed, when in the condition of peat, must have
    been 60 feet thick; and assuming that one foot of peat would be formed
    in a century, he concludes that 6,000 years must have been required
    for the growth of the coal plants. According to Liebig, 9,600 years
    would be required. This, as we have already seen, is about the average
    duration of a warm period.</p>

  <p>In these beds have been found the bones of the elephant (<i>E. Merkii</i>),
    stag, cave-bear, and other animals. Numerous insects have also been met
    with, which further prove the warm, mild condition of climate which
    must have prevailed at the time of the formation of the lignite.</p>

  <p>At Hoxne, near Diss, in Suffolk, a black peaty mass several feet thick,
    containing fragments of wood of the oak, yew, and fir, was found,
    overlying the boulder clay.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Professor Vogt believes that this peat
    bed is of the same age as the lignite beds of Switzerland.</p>

  <p>In the glacial drift of North America, particularly about Lake
    Champlain and the valley of the St. Lawrence, there is similar evidence
    of two glacial periods with an intervening non-glacial or warm
    period.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

  <p><em>Glacial and Inter-glacial Periods of the Southern Hemisphere</em>—(<em>South
    Africa</em>).—Mr. G. W. Stow, in a paper on the “Geology of South
    Africa,”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> describes a recent glaciation extending over a large
    portion of Natal, British Kaffraria, the Kaga and Krome mountains,
    which he attributes to the action of land-ice. He sums up the phenomena
    as follows:—“The rounding off of the hills in the interiors of the
    ancient basins; the numerous dome-shaped (<i>roches moutonnée</i>) rocks;
    the enormous erratic boulders in positions where water could not have
    carried them; the frequency of unstratified clays—clays with imbedded
    angular boulders; drift and lofty mounds of boulders; large tracts of
    country thickly spread over with unstratified clays and superimposed
    fragments of rock; the Oliphant’s-Hoek clay, and the vast piles of Enon
    conglomerate.” In addition to these results of ice-action, he records
    the discovery by himself of distinct ice-scratches or groovings on the
    surface of the rocks at Reit-Poort in the Tarka, and subsequently<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
    the discovery by Mr. G. Gilfillan of a large boulder at Pniel with
    <i lang="la">striæ</i> distinctly marked upon it, and also that the same observer
    found that almost every boulder in the gravel at “Moonlight Rush” had
    unmistakable striæ on one or more sides.</p>

  <p>In South Africa there is evidence not only of a glacial condition
    during the Pliocene period, but also of a warmer climate than now
    prevails in that region. “The evidence,” says Mr. Stow, “of the
    Pliocene shells of the superficial limestone of the Zwartkops heights,
    and elsewhere, leads us to believe that the climate of South Africa
    must have been of a far more tropical character than at present.</p>

  <p>“Take, for instance, the characteristic <i lang="la">Venericardia</i> of that
    limestone. This has migrated along the coast some 29° or 30° and is now
    found within a few degrees of the equator, near Zanzibar, gradually
    driven, as I presume it must have been, further and further north by a
    gradual lowering of the temperature of the more southern parts of this
    coast since the limestone was deposited.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

  <p>“During the formation of the shell-banks in the Zwartkops estuary,
    younger than the Pliocene limestone, the immense number of certain
    species of shells, which have as yet been found living only in
    latitudes nearer the equator, point to a somewhat similar though a more
    modified change of temperature.”</p>

  <p><em>Inter-glacial Beds of Scotland.</em>—Upwards of a dozen years ago,
    Professor Geikie arrived, from his own observations of the glacial
    drift of Scotland, at a similar conclusion to that of M. Morlot
    regarding the intercalation of warm periods during the glacial epoch;
    and the facts on which Professor Geikie’s conclusions were based are
    briefly as follows. In a cliff of boulder clay on the banks of the
    Slitrig Water, near the town of Hawick, he observed a bed of stones
    or shingle. Over the lower stratum of stones lay a few inches of
    well-stratified sand, silt, and clay, some of the layers being black
    and peaty, <em>with enclosed vegetable fibres</em> in a crumbling state.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
    There were some 30 or 40 feet of boulder clay above these stratified
    beds, and 15 or 20 feet under them. The stones in the shingle band
    were identical with those of the boulder clay, but they showed no
    striations, and were more rounded and water-worn, and resembled in
    every respect the stones now lying in the bed of the Slitrig. The
    section of the cliff stood as under:—</p>

  <p>A few more cases of intercalation of stratified materials in the true
    till were also found in the same valley.</p>

  <p>In a cliff of stiff brown boulder clay, about 20 feet high, on the
    banks of the Carmichael Water, Lanarkshire, Professor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>Geikie observed
    a stratified bed of clay about 3 or 4 inches in thickness. About a mile
    higher up the stream, he found a series of beds of gravel, sand, and
    clay in the true <em>till</em>. “A thin seam of <em>peaty matter</em>,” he says, “was
    observed to run for a few inches along the bottom of a bed of clay and
    then disappear, while in a band of fine laminated clay with thin sandy
    partings occasional <em>fragments of mouldering wood</em> were found.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

  <p>At Chapelhall, near Airdrie, a sand-bed has been extensively mined
    under about 114 feet of till. This bed of finely stratified sand
    is about 20 feet thick. In it were found lenticular beds of fine
    pale-coloured clay containing layers of peat and decaying twigs and
    branches. Professor Geikie found the vegetable fibres, though much
    decayed, still distinct, and the substance when put into the fire
    burned with a dull lambent flame. Underlying these stratified beds, and
    forming the floor of the mine, is a deposit of <em>the true till</em> about
    24 feet in thickness. In another pit adjoining, the till forming the
    floor is 30 feet thick, but it is sometimes absent altogether, so as to
    leave the sand beds resting directly on the sandstone and shale of the
    coal-measures. At some distance from this sand-pit an old buried river
    channel was met with in one of the pit workings. This channel was found
    to contain a coating of boulder clay, on which the laminated sands and
    clays reposed, showing, as Professor Geikie has pointed out, that this
    old channel had been filled with boulder clay, and then re-excavated
    to allow of the deposition of the stratified deposits. Over all lay a
    thick mantle of boulder clay which buried the whole.</p>

  <p>A case somewhat similar was found by Professor Nicol in a cutting on
    the Edinburgh and Leith Railway. In many places the till had been
    worn into hollows as if part of it had been removed by the action of
    running water.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> One of these hollows, about 5 or 6 feet wide by 3
    or 4 feet deep, closely resembled the channel of a small stream. It
    was also filled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>with gravel and sand, in all respects like that found
    in such a stream at the present day. It was seen to exhibit the same
    characters on both sides of the cutting, but Professor Nicol was unable
    to determine how far it may have extended beyond; but he had no doubt
    whatever that it had been formed by a stream of water. Over this old
    watercourse was a thick deposit of true till.</p>

  <p>In reference to the foregoing cases, Professor Geikie makes the
    following pertinent remarks:—“Here it is evident that the scooping out
    of this channel belongs to the era of the boulder clay. It must have
    been effected during a pause in the deposition of the clay, when a run
    of water could find its way along the inequalities of the surface of
    the clay. This pause must have been of sufficient duration to enable
    the runnel to excavate a capacious channel for itself, and leave in it
    a quantity of sand and shingle. We can scarcely doubt that when this
    process was going on the ground must have been a land surface, and
    could not have been under the sea. And lastly, we see from the upper
    boulder clay that the old conditions returned, the watercourse was
    choked up, and another mass of chaotic boulder clay was tumbled down
    upon the face of the country. This indicates that the boulder clay is
    not the result of one great catastrophe, but of slow and silent, yet
    mighty, forces acting sometimes with long pauses throughout a vast
    cycle of time.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

  <p>At Craiglockhart Hill, about a mile south of Edinburgh, an extensive
    bed of fine sand of from one to three feet in thickness was found
    between two distinct masses of true boulder clay or till. The sand was
    extensively used for building purposes during the erection of the city
    poorhouse a few years ago. In this sand-bed I found a great many tree
    roots in the position in which they had grown. During the time of the
    excavations I visited the place almost daily, and had every opportunity
    of satisfying myself that this sand-bed, prior to the time of the
    formation of the upper boulder clay, must have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>been a land surface
    on which the roots had grown. In no case did I find them penetrating
    into the upper boulder clay, and in several places I found stones of
    the upper clay resting directly on the broken ends of the roots. These
    roots were examined by Professor Balfour, but they were so decayed that
    he was unable to determine their character.</p>

  <p>In digging a foundation for a building in Leith Walk, Edinburgh, a few
    years ago, two distinct beds of sand were passed through, the upper,
    about 10 feet in thickness, rested upon what appeared to be a denuded
    surface of the lower bed. In this lower bed, which evidently had been
    a land surface, numbers of tree roots were found. I had the pleasure
    of examining them along with my friend Mr. C. W. Peach, who first
    directed my attention to them. In no instance were the roots found
    in the upper bed. That these roots did not belong to trees which had
    grown on the present surface and penetrated to that depth, was further
    evident from the fact that in one or two cases we found the roots
    broken off at the place where they had been joined to the trunk, and
    there the upper sand-bed over them was more than 10 feet in thickness.
    If we assume that the roots belonged to trees which had grown on the
    present surface, then we must also assume, what no one would be willing
    to admit, that the trunks of the trees had grown downwards into the
    earth to a depth of upwards of ten feet. I have shown these roots to
    several botanists, but none of them could determine to what trees they
    belonged. The surface of the ground at the spot in question is 45 feet
    above sea-level. Mr. Peach and I have found similar roots in the under
    sand-bed at several other places in the same neighbourhood. That they
    belong to an inter-glacial period appears probable for the following
    reasons:—(1.) This upper sand-bed is overlaid by a tough clay, which
    in all respects appears to be the same as the Portobello clay, which
    we know belongs to the glacial series. In company with Mr. Bennie,
    I found the clay in some places to be contorted in a similar manner
    to the Portobello clays. (2.) In a sand-pit about one or two hundred
    yards to the west of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> where the roots were found, the sand-bed was
    found contorted in the most extraordinary manner to a depth of about 15
    feet. In fact, for a space of more than 30 feet, the bedding had been
    completely turned up on end without the fine layers being in the least
    degree broken or disarranged, showing that they had been upturned by
    some enormous powers acting on a large mass of the sand.</p>

  <p>One of the best examples of true till to be met with in the
    neighbourhood of Edinburgh is at Redhall Quarry, about three miles to
    the south-west of the city. In recently opening up a new quarry near
    the old one a bed of peat was found intercalated in the thick mass of
    till overlying the rock. The clay overlying and underlying the peat-bed
    was carefully examined by Mr. John Henderson,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and found to be true
    till.</p>

  <p>In a quarry at Overtown, near Beith, Ayrshire, a sedimentary bed of
    clay, intercalated between two boulder clays, was some years ago
    observed by Mr. Robert Craig, of the Glasgow Geological Society. This
    bed filled an elliptical basin about 130 yards long, and about 30 yards
    broad. Its thickness averaged from one to two feet. This sedimentary
    bed rested on the till on the north-east end of the basin, and was
    itself overlaid on the south-west end by the upper bed of till. The
    clay bed was found to be full of roots and stems of the common hazel.
    That these roots had grown in the position in which they were found
    was evident from the fact that they were in many places found to pass
    into the “cutters” or fissures of the limestone, and were here found
    in a flattened form, having in growing accommodated themselves to the
    size and shape of the fissures. Nuts of the hazel were plentifully
    found.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

  <p>At Hillhead, some distance from Overtown, there is a similar
    intercalated bed full of hazel remains, and a species of freshwater
    <i>Ostracoda</i> was detected by Mr. David Robertson.</p>

  <p>In a railway cutting a short distance from Beith, Mr. Craig pointed out
    to my colleague, Mr. Jack, and myself, a thin <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>layer of peaty matter,
    extending for a considerable distance between an upper and lower mass
    of till; and at one place we found a piece of oak about four feet in
    length and about seven or eight inches in thickness. This oak boulder
    was well polished and striated.</p>

  <p>Not far from this place is the famous Crofthead inter-glacial bed, so
    well known from the description given by Mr. James Geikie and others
    that I need not here describe it. I had the pleasure of visiting the
    section twice while it was well exposed, once, in company with Mr.
    James Geikie, and I do not entertain the shadow of a doubt as to its
    true inter-glacial character.</p>

  <p>In the silt, evidently the mud of an inter-glacial lake, were found the
    upper portion of the skull of the great extinct ox (<i>Bos primigenius</i>),
    horns of the Irish elk or deer, and bones of the horse. In the detailed
    list of the lesser organic remains found in the intercalated peat-bed
    by Mr. J. A. Mahony,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> are the following, viz., three species of
    <i>Desmidaceæ</i>, thirty-one species of <i>Diatomaceæ</i>, eleven species of
    mosses, nine species of phanerogamous plants, and several species of
    annelids, crustacea, and insects. This list clearly shows that the
    inter-glacial period, represented by these remains, was not only mild
    and warm, but of considerable duration. Mr. David Robertson found in
    the clay under the peat several species of <i>Ostracoda</i>.</p>

  <p>The well-known Kilmaurs bed of peaty matter in which the remains of
    the mammoth and reindeer were found, has now by the researches of the
    Geological Survey been proved to be of inter-glacial age.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

  <p>In Ireland, as shown by Professors Hull and Harkness, the inter-glacial
    beds, called by them the “manure gravels,” contain numerous fragments
    of shells indicating a more genial climate than prevailed when the
    boulder clays lying above and below them were formed.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

  <p>In Sweden inter-glacial beds of freshwater origin, containing plants,
    have been met with by Herr Nathorst and also by Herr Holmström.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

  <p>In North America Mr. Whittlesey describes inter-glacial beds of blue
    clay enclosing pieces of wood, intercalated with beds of hard pan
    (till). Professor Newberry found at Germantown, Ohio, an immense bed of
    peat, from 12 to 20 feet in thickness, underlying, in some places 30
    feet, and in other places as much as 80 feet, of till, and overlying
    drift beds. The uppermost layers of the peat contain undecomposed
    sphagnous mosses, grasses, and sedges, but in the other portions of
    the bed abundant fragments of coniferous wood, identified as red cedar
    (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>), have been found. Ash, hickory, sycamore,
    together with grape-vines and beech-leaves, were also met with, and
    with these the remains of the mastodon and great extinct beaver.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

  <p><em>Inter-glacial Beds of England.</em>—Scotland has been so much denuded by
    the ice sheet with which it was covered during the period of maximum
    glaciation that little can be learned in this part of the island
    regarding the early history of the glacial epoch. But in England,
    and more especially in the south-eastern portion of it, matters are
    somewhat different. We have, in the Norwich Crag and Chillesford beds,
    a formation pretty well developed, which is now generally regarded as
    lying at the base of the Glacial Series. That this formation is of a
    glacial character is evident from the fact of its containing shells of
    a northern type, such as <i>Leda lanceolata</i>, <i>Cardium Groènlandicum</i>,
    <i>Lucina borealis</i>, <i>Cyprina Islandica</i>, <i>Panopæa Norvegica</i>, and
    <i>Mya truncata</i>. But the glacial character of the formation is
    more strikingly brought out, as Sir Charles Lyell remarks, by the
    predominance of such species as <i>Rhynchonella psittacea</i>, <i>Tellina
    calcarea</i>, <i>Astarte borealis</i>, <i>Scalaria Groènlandica</i>, and <i>Fusus
    carinatus</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

  <p><em>The “Forest Beds.”</em>—Immediately following this in the order of
    time comes the famous “Forest Bed” of Cromer. This buried forest has
    been traced for more than forty miles along the coast from Cromer to
    near Kessengland, and consists of stumps of trees standing erect,
    attached to their roots, penetrating the original soil in which they
    grew. Here and in the overlying fluvio-marine beds we have the first
    evidence of at least a temperate, if not a warm, inter-glacial period.
    This is evident from the character of the flora and fauna belonging
    to these beds. Among the trees we have, for example, the Scotch and
    spruce fir, the yew, the oak, birch, the alder, and the common sloe.
    There have also been found the white and yellow water-lilies, the
    pond-weed, and others. Amongst the mammalia have been met with the
    <i>Elephas meridionalis</i>, also found in the Lower Pliocene beds of the
    Val d’Arno, near Florence; <i>Elephas antiquus</i>, <i>Hippopotamus major</i>,
    <i>Rhinoceros Etruscus</i>, the two latter Val d’Arno species, the roebuck,
    the horse, the stag, the Irish elk, the <i>Cervus Polignacus</i>, found
    also at Mont Perrier, France, <i>C. verticornis</i>, and <i>C. carnutorum</i>,
    the latter also found in Pliocene strata of St. Prest, France. In
    the fluvio-marine series have been found the <i>Cyclas omnica</i> and the
    <i>Paludina marginata</i>, a species of mollusc still found in the South of
    France, but no longer inhabiting the British Isles.</p>

  <p>Above the forest bed and fluvio-marine series comes the well-known
    unstratified Norwich boulder till, containing immense blocks 6 or 8
    feet in diameter, many of which must have come from Scandinavia, and
    above the unstratified till are a series of contorted beds of sand and
    gravel. This series may be considered to represent a period of intense
    glaciation. Above this again comes the middle drift of Mr. Searles
    Wood, junior, yielding shells which indicate, as is now generally
    admitted, a comparatively mild condition of climate. Upon this middle
    drift lies the upper boulder clay, which is well developed in South
    Norfolk and Suffolk, and which is of unmistakable glacial origin. Newer
    than all these are the Mundesley freshwater beds, which lie in a hollow
    denuded out of the foregoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> series. In this formation a black peaty
    deposit containing seeds of plants, insects, shells, and scales and
    bones of fishes, has been found, all indicating a mild and temperate
    condition of climate. Among the shells there is, as in the forest bed,
    the <i>Paludina marginata</i>. And that an arctic condition of things in
    England followed is believed by Mr. Fisher and others, on the evidence
    of the “Trail” described by the former observer.</p>

  <p><em>Cave and River Deposits.</em>—Evidence of the existence of warm periods
    during the glacial epoch is derived from a class of facts which
    have long been regarded by geologists as very puzzling, namely, the
    occurrence of mollusca and mammalia of a southern type associated
    in England and on the continent with those of an extremely arctic
    character. For example, <i>Cyrena fluminalis</i> is a shell which does not
    live at present in any European river, but inhabits the Nile and parts
    of Asia, especially Cashmere. <i>Unio littoralis</i>, extinct in Britain,
    is still abundant in the Loire; <i>Paludina marginata</i> does not exist
    in this country. These shells of a southern type have been found in
    post-tertiary deposits at Gray’s Thurrock, in Essex; in the valley
    of the Ouse, near Bedford; and at Hoxne, in Suffolk, associated with
    a <i>Hippopotamus</i> closely allied to that now inhabiting the Nile, and
    <i>Elephas antiquus</i>, an animal remarkable for its southern range.
    Amongst other forms of a southern type which have been met with in
    the cave and river deposits, are the spotted hyæna from Africa,
    an animal, says Mr. Dawkins, identical, except in size, with the
    cave hyæna, the African elephant (<i>E. Africanus</i>), and the <i>Elephas
    meridionalis</i>, the great beaver (<i>Trogontherium</i>), the cave hyæna
    (<i>Hyæna spelæa</i>), the cave lion (<i>Felis leo</i>, var. <i>spelæa</i>), the lynx
    (<i>Felis lynx</i>), the sabre-toothed tiger (<i>Machairodus latidens</i>), the
    rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros megarhinus</i> and <i>R. leptorhinus</i>). But the
    most extraordinary thing is that along with these, associated in the
    same beds, have been found the remains of such animals of an arctic
    type as the glutton (<i>Gulo luscus</i>), the ermine (<i>Mustela erminea</i>),
    the reindeer (<i>Cervus tarandus</i>), the musk-ox or musk-sheep (<i>Ovibos
    moschatus</i>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> the aurochs (<i>Bison priscus</i>), the woolly rhinoceros
    (<i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>), the mammoth (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>), and
    others of a like character. According to Mr. Boyd Dawkins, these
    southern animals extended as far north as Yorkshire in England, and
    the northern animals as far south as the latitude of the Alps and
    Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

  <p><em>The Explanation of the Difficulty.</em>—As an explanation of these
    puzzling phenomena, I suggested, in the Philosophical Magazine for
    November, 1868, that these southern animals lived in our island during
    the warm periods of the glacial epoch, while the northern animals
    lived during the cold periods. This view I am happy to find has lately
    been supported by Sir John Lubbock; further, Mr. James Geikie, in his
    “Great Ice Age,” and also in the Geological Magazine, has entered so
    fully into the subject and brought forward such a body of evidence
    in support of it, that, in all probability, it will, ere long, be
    generally accepted. The only objection which has been advanced, so far
    as I am aware, deserving of serious consideration, is that by Mr. Boyd
    Dawkins, who holds that if these migrations had been <em>secular</em> instead
    of seasonal, as is supposed by Sir Charles Lyell and himself, the
    arctic and southern animals would now be found in separate deposits.
    It is perfectly true that if there had been only one cold and one warm
    period, each of geologically immense duration, the remains might, of
    course, be expected to have been found in separate beds; but when
    we consider that the glacial epoch consisted of a long <em>succession
    of alternate cold and warm periods</em>, of not more than ten or twelve
    thousand years each, we can hardly expect that in the river deposits
    belonging to this long cycle we should be able to distinguish the
    deposits of the cold periods from those of the warm.</p>

  <p><em>Shell Beds.</em>—Evidence of warm inter-glacial periods may be justly
    inferred from the presence of shells of a southern type which have been
    found in glacial beds, of which some illustrations follow.</p>

  <p>In the southern parts of Norway, from the present sea-level <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>up to 500
    feet, are found glacial shell beds, similar to those of Scotland. In
    these beds <i>Trochus magus</i>, <i>Tapes decussata</i>, and <i>Pholas candida</i>
    have been found, shells which are distributed between the Mediterranean
    and the shores of England, but no longer live round the coasts of
    Norway.</p>

  <p>At Capellbacken, near Udevalla, in Sweden, there is an extensive bed of
    shells 20 to 30 feet in thickness. This formation has been described
    by Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It consists of several distinct layers,
    apparently representing many epochs and conditions. Its shells are of a
    highly arctic character, and several of the species have not been found
    living south of the arctic circle. But the remarkable circumstance
    is that it contains <i>Cypræa lurida</i>, a Mediterranean shell, which
    Mr. Jeffreys, after some hesitation, believed to belong to the bed.
    Again, at Lilleherstehagen, a short distance from Capellbacken,
    another extensive deposit is exposed. “Here the upper layer,” says Mr.
    Jeffreys, “gives a singular result. Mixed with the universal <i>Trophon
    clathratus</i> (which is a high northern species, and found living only
    within the arctic circle) are many shells of a southern type, such are
    <i>Ostrea edulis</i>, <i>Tapes pullastra</i>, <i>Corbula gibba</i>, and <i>Aporrhais
    pes-pelicani</i>.”</p>

  <p>At Kempsey, near Worcester, a shell bed is described by Sir R.
    Murchison in his “Silurian System” (p. 533), in which <i>Bulla ampulla</i>
    and a species of <i>Oliva</i>, shells of a southern type, have been found.</p>

  <p>A case somewhat similar to the above is recorded by the Rev. Mr.
    Crosskey as having been met with in Scotland at the Kyles of Bute.
    “Among the Clyde beds, I have found,” he says, “a layer containing
    shells, in which those of a more southern type appear to exist in
    greater profusion and perfection than even in our present seas. It is
    an open question,” he continues, “whether our climate was not slightly
    warmer than it is now between the glacial epoch and the present
    day.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

  <p>In a glacial bed near Greenock, Mr. A. Bell found the fry of living
    Mediterranean forms, viz., <i>Conus Mediterraneus</i> and <i>Cardita trapezia</i>.</p>

  <p>Although deposits containing shells of a temperate or of a southern
    type in glacial beds have not been often recorded, it by no means
    follows that such deposits are actually of rare occurrence. That
    glacial beds should contain deposits indicating a temperate or a
    warm condition of climate is a thing so contrary to all preconceived
    opinions regarding the sequence of events during the glacial epoch,
    that most geologists, were they to meet with a shell of a southern
    type in one of those beds, would instantly come to the conclusion that
    its occurrence there was purely accidental, and would pay no special
    attention to the matter.</p>

  <p><em>Evidence derived from “Borings.”</em>—With the view of ascertaining if
    additional light would be cast on the sequence of events, during the
    formation of the boulder clay, by an examination of the journals of
    bores made through a great depth of surface deposits, I collected,
    during the summer of 1867, about two hundred and fifty such records,
    put down in all parts of the mining districts of Scotland. An
    examination of these bores shows most conclusively that the opinion
    that the boulder clay, or lower till, is one great undivided formation,
    is wholly erroneous.</p>

  <p>These two hundred and fifty bores represent a total thickness of 21,348
    feet, giving 86 feet as the mean thickness of the deposits passed
    through. Twenty of these have one boulder clay, with beds of stratified
    sand or gravel beneath the clay; twenty-five have <em>two</em> boulder clays,
    with stratified beds of sand and gravel between; ten have <em>three</em>
    boulder clays; one has <em>four</em> boulder clays; two have <em>five</em> boulder
    clays; and no one has fewer than <em>six</em> separate masses of boulder
    clay, with stratified beds of sand and gravel between; sixteen have
    two or three separate boulder clays, differing altogether in colour
    and hardness, without any stratified beds between. We have, therefore,
    out of two hundred and fifty bores, seventy-five of them representing
    a condition <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>of things wholly different from that exhibited to the
    geologist in ordinary sections.</p>

  <p>The full details of the character of the deposits passed through by
    these bores, and their bearing on the history of the glacial epoch,
    have been given by Mr. James Bennie, in an interesting paper read
    before the Glasgow Geological Society,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> to which I would refer all
    those interested in the subject of surface geology.</p>

  <p>The evidence afforded by these bores of the existence of warm
    inter-glacial periods will, however, fall to be considered in a
    subsequent chapter.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

  <p>Another important and unexpected result obtained from these bores to
    which we shall have occasion to refer, was the evidence which they
    afforded of a Continental Period.</p>

  <p><em>Striated Pavements.</em>—It has been sometimes observed that in horizontal
    sections of the boulder clay, the stones and boulders are all striated
    in one uniform direction, and this has been effected over the original
    markings on the boulders. It has been inferred from this that a pause
    of long duration must have taken place in the formation of the boulder
    clay, during which the ice disappeared and the clay became hardened
    into a solid mass. After which the old condition of things returned,
    glaciers again appeared, passed over the surface of the hardened clay
    with its imbedded boulders, and ground it down in the same way as they
    had formerly done the solid rocks underneath the clay.</p>

  <p>An instance of striated pavements in the boulder clay was observed by
    Mr. Robert Chambers in a cliff between Portobello and Fisherrow. At
    several places a narrow train of blocks was observed crossing the line
    of the beach, somewhat like a quay or mole, but not more than a foot
    above the general level. All the blocks <em>had flat sides uppermost,
    and all the flat sides were striated in the same direction</em> as that
    of the rocky surface throughout <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>the country. A similar instance was
    also observed between Leith and Portobello. “There is, in short,” says
    Mr. Chambers, “a surface of the boulder clay, deep down in the entire
    bed, which, to appearance, has been in precisely the same circumstances
    as the fast rock surface below had previously been. It has had in its
    turn to sustain the weight and abrading force of the glacial agent,
    in whatever form it was applied; and the additional deposits of the
    boulder clay left over this surface may be presumed to have been formed
    by the agent on that occasion.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

  <p>Several cases of a similar character were observed by Mr. James
    Smith, of Jordanhill, on the beach at Row, and on the shore of the
    Gareloch.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Between Dunbar and Cockburnspath, Professor Geikie found
    along the beach, for a space of 30 or 40 square yards, numbers of large
    blocks of limestone with flattened upper sides, imbedded in a stiff red
    clay, and all striated in one direction. On the shores of the Solway he
    found another example.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

  <p>The cases of striated pavements recorded are, however, not very
    numerous. But this by no means shows that they are of rare occurrence
    in the boulder clay. These pavements, of course, are to be found only
    in the interior of the mass, and even there they can only be seen
    along a horizontal section. But sections of this kind are rarely to be
    met with, for river channels, quarries, railway cuttings, and other
    excavations of a similar character which usually lay open the boulder
    clay, exhibit vertical sections only. It is therefore only along the
    sea-shore, as Professor Geikie remarks, where the surface of the clay
    has been worn away by the action of the waves, that opportunities have
    hitherto been presented to the geologist for observing them.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that during the warm periods of the glacial
    epoch our island would be clothed with a luxuriant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>flora. At the end
    of a cold period, when the ice had disappeared, the whole face of the
    country would be covered over to a considerable depth with a confused
    mass of stones and boulder clay. A surface thus wholly destitute of
    every seed and germ would probably remain for years without vegetation.
    But through course of time life would begin to appear, and during
    the thousands of years of perpetual summer which would follow, the
    soil, uncongenial as it no doubt must have been, would be forced to
    sustain a luxuriant vegetation. But although this was the case, we
    need not wonder that now scarcely a single vestige of it remains; for
    when the ice sheet again crept over the island everything animate and
    inanimate would be ground down to powder. We are certain that prior
    to the glacial epoch our island must have been covered with life and
    vegetation. But not a single vestige of these are now to be found;
    no, not even of the very soil on which the vegetation grew. The solid
    rock itself upon which the soil lay has been ground down to mud by the
    ice sheet, and, to a large extent, as Professor Geikie remarks, swept
    away into the adjoining seas.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> It is now even more difficult to
    find a trace of the ancient soil <em>under</em> the boulder clay than it is
    to find remains of the soil of the warm periods <em>in</em> that clay. As
    regards Scotland, cases of old land surfaces under the boulder clay are
    as seldom recorded as cases of old land surfaces in it. In so far as
    geology is concerned, there is as much evidence to show that our island
    was clothed with vegetation during the glacial epoch as there is that
    it was so clothed prior to that epoch.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the temperate regions the cold periods of the glacial epoch would be
    far more marked than the warm inter-glacial periods. The condition of
    things which prevailed during the cold periods would differ far more
    widely from that which now prevails than would the condition of things
    during the warm periods. But as regards the polar regions the reverse
    would be the case; there the warm inter-glacial periods would be far
    more marked than the cold periods. The condition of things prevailing
    in those regions during the warm periods would be in strongest contrast
    to what now obtains, but this would not hold true in reference to the
    cold periods; for during the latter, matters there would be pretty
    much the same as at present, only a good deal more severe. The reason
    of this may be seen from what has already been stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>;
    but as it is a point of considerable importance in order to a proper
    understanding of the physical state of things prevailing in polar
    regions during the glacial epoch, I shall consider this part of the
    subject more fully.</p>

  <p>During the cold periods, our island, and nearly all places in the
    northern temperate regions down to about the same latitude, would be
    covered with snow and ice, and all animal and vegetable life within
    the glaciated area would to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> extent be destroyed. The presence
    of the ice would of itself, for reasons already explained, lower the
    mean annual temperature to near the freezing-point. The summers,
    notwithstanding the proximity of the sun, would not be warm, on the
    contrary their temperature would rise little above the freezing-point.
    An excess of evaporation would no doubt take place, owing to the
    increase in the intensity of the sun’s rays, but this result would only
    tend to increase the snowfall.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

  <p>During the warm periods our country and the regions under consideration
    would experience conditions not differing much from those of the
    present, but the climate would probably be somewhat warmer and more
    equable. The proximity of the sun during winter would prevent snow
    from falling. The summers, owing to the greater distance of the sun,
    would probably be somewhat colder than they are now. But the loss of
    heat during summer would be to a large extent compensated for by two
    causes to which we must here refer. (1.) The much greater amount of
    heat conveyed by ocean-currents than at present. (2.) Our summers are
    now cooled to a considerable extent by cold aërial currents from the
    ice-covered regions of the north. But during the period in question
    there would be little or no ice in arctic regions, consequently the
    winds would be comparatively warm, whatever direction they came from.</p>

  <p>Let us next direct our attention to the state of things in the arctic
    regions during the glacial epoch. At present Greenland and other parts
    of the arctic regions occupied by land are almost wholly covered
    with ice, and as a consequence nearly destitute of vegetable life.
    During the cold periods of the glacial epoch the quantity of snow
    falling would doubtless be greater and the ice thicker, but as regards
    organic life, matters would not probably be much worse than they are
    at present. In fact, so far as Greenland and the antarctic continent
    are concerned, they are about as destitute of plant life as they can
    be. Although an increase in the thickness of the arctic ice would not
    greatly alter the present state of matters in those regions, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>yet what
    a transformation would ensue upon the disappearance of the ice! This
    would not only raise the summer temperature some twenty degrees or so,
    but would afford the necessary conditions for the existence of abundant
    animal and plant life. The severity of the climate of Greenland is
    due to a very considerable extent, as we have already seen, to the
    presence of ice. Get rid of the permanent ice, and the temperature of
    the country, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, would instantly rise. That Greenland
    should ever have enjoyed a temperate climate, capable of supporting
    abundant vegetation, has often been matter of astonishment, but this
    wonder diminishes when we reflect that during the warm periods it would
    be in the arctic regions that the greatest heating effect would take
    place, this being due mainly to the transference of nearly all the warm
    inter-tropical waters to one hemisphere.</p>

  <p>It has been shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> that the heating effects at present
    resulting from the transference of heat by ocean-currents increase as
    we approach the poles. As a consequence of this it follows that during
    the warm periods, when the quantity of warm water transferred would be
    nearly doubled, the <em>increase of heat resulting from this cause would
    itself increase</em> as the warm pole was approached. This effect, combined
    with the shortness of the winter in perihelion and the nearness of the
    sun during that season, would prevent the accumulation of snow. During
    summer, the sun, it is true, would be at a much greater distance from
    the earth than at present, but it must be borne in mind that for a
    period of three months the quantity of heat received from the sun at
    the north pole would be greater than that received at the equator.
    Consequently, after the winter’s snow was melted, this great amount of
    heat would go to raise the temperature, and the arctic summer could
    not be otherwise than hot. It is not hot at present, but this, be it
    observed, is because of the presence of the ice. When we take all these
    facts into consideration we need not be surprised that Greenland once
    enjoyed a condition of climate totally different from that which now
    obtains in that region.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

  <p>It is, therefore, in the arctic and antarctic regions where we ought
    to find the most marked and decided evidence of warm inter-glacial
    periods. And doubtless such evidence would be abundantly forthcoming
    had these regions not been subjected to such intense denudation since
    the glacial epoch, and were so large a portion of the land not still
    buried beneath an icy covering, and therefore beyond the geologist’s
    reach. Only on islands and such outlying places as are not shrouded in
    snow and ice can we hope to meet with any trace of the warm periods of
    the glacial epoch: and we may now proceed to consider what relics of
    these warm periods have actually been discovered in arctic regions.</p>

  <p><em>Evidence of Warm Periods in Arctic Regions.</em>—The fact that stumps,
    &amp;c., of full-grown trees have been found in places where at present
    nothing is to be met with but fields of snow and ice, and where the
    mean annual temperature scarcely rises above the zero of the Fahrenheit
    thermometer, is good evidence to show that the climate of the arctic
    regions was once much warmer than now. The remains of an ancient forest
    were discovered by Captain McClure, in Banks’s Land, in latitude 74°
    48′. He found a great accumulation of trees, from the sea-level to an
    elevation of upwards of 300 feet. “I entered a ravine,” says Captain
    McClure, “some miles inland, and found the north side of it, for a
    depth of 40 feet from the surface, composed of one mass of wood similar
    to what I had before seen.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> In the ravine he observed a tree
    protruding about 8 feet, and 3 feet in circumference. And he further
    states that, “<em>From the perfect state of the bark</em>, and the position of
    the trees so far from the sea, there can be but little doubt that they
    grew originally in the country.” A cone of one of these fir-trees was
    brought home, and was found to belong apparently to the genus <i>Abies</i>,
    resembling <i>A. (Pinus) alba</i>.</p>

  <p>In Prince Patrick’s Island, in latitude 76° 12′ N., longitude 122°
    W., near the head of Walker Inlet, and a considerable distance in the
    interior in one of the ravines, a tree protruding <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>about 10 feet from
    a bank was discovered by Lieutenant Mecham. It proved to be 4 feet
    in circumference. In its neighbourhood several others were seen, all
    of them similar to some he had found at Cape Manning; each of them
    measured 4 feet round and 30 feet in length. The carpenter stated that
    the trees resembled larch. Lieutenant Mecham, from their appearance and
    position, concluded that they must have grown in the country.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

  <p>Trees under similar conditions were also found by Lieutenant Pim on
    Prince Patrick’s Island, and by Captain Parry on Melville Island, all
    considerably above the present sea-level and at a distance from the
    shore. On the coast of New Siberia, Lieutenant Anjou found a cliff of
    clay containing stems of trees still capable of being used for fuel.</p>

  <p>“This remarkable phenomenon,” says Captain Osborn, “opens a vast field
    for conjecture, and the imagination becomes bewildered in trying to
    realise that period of the world’s history when the absence of ice and
    a milder climate allowed forest trees to grow in a region where now the
    ground-willow and dwarf-birch have to struggle for existence.”</p>

  <p>Sir Roderick Murchison came to the conclusion that all those trees
    were drifted to their present position when the islands of the arctic
    archipelago were submerged. But it was the difficulty of accounting
    for the growth of trees in such a region which led him to adopt this
    hypothesis. His argument is this: “If we imagine,” he says, “that the
    timber found in those latitudes grew on the spot we should be driven
    to adopt the anomalous hypothesis that, notwithstanding physical
    relations of land and water similar to those which now prevail, trees
    of large size grew on such <i lang="la">terra firma</i> within a few degrees of the
    north pole!—a supposition which I consider to be wholly incompatible
    with the data in our possession, and at variance with the laws of the
    isothermal lines.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This reasoning of Sir Roderick’s may be quite
    correct, on the supposition that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>changes of climate are due to changes
    in the distribution of sea and land, as advocated by Sir Charles Lyell.
    But these difficulties disappear if we adopt the views advocated in
    the foregoing chapters. As Captain Osborn has pointed out, however,
    Sir Roderick’s hypothesis leaves the real difficulty untouched. “A
    very different climate,” he says, “must then have existed in those
    regions to allow driftwood so perfect as to retain its bark to reach
    such great distances; and perhaps it may be argued that if that sea was
    sufficiently clear of ice to allow such timber to drift unscathed to
    Prince Patrick’s Land, that that <em>very absence of a frozen sea would
    allow fir-trees to grow in a soil naturally fertile</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

  <p>As has been already stated, all who have seen those trees in arctic
    regions agree in thinking that they grew <i lang="la">in situ</i>. And Professor
    Haughton, in his excellent account of the arctic archipelago appended
    to McClintock’s “Narrative of Arctic Discoveries,” after a careful
    examination of the entire evidence on the subject, is distinctly of
    the same opinion; while the recent researches of Professor Heer put it
    beyond doubt that the drift theory must be abandoned.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the arctic archipelago was submerged to an extent that
    could have admitted of those trees being floated to their present
    positions. This, as we shall see, follows from theory; but submergence,
    without a warmer condition of climate, would not enable trees to reach
    those regions with their bark entire.</p>

  <p>But in reality we are not left to theorise on the subject, for we
    have a well-authenticated case of one of those trees being got by
    Captain Belcher standing erect in the position in which it grew. It was
    found immediately to the northward of the narrow strait opening into
    Wellington Sound, in lat. 75° 32′ N. long. 92° W., and about a mile and
    a half inland. The tree was dug up out of the frozen ground, and along
    with it a portion of the soil which was immediately in contact with the
    roots. The whole was packed in canvas and brought to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>England. Near to
    the spot several knolls of peat mosses about nine inches in depth were
    found, containing the bones of the lemming in great numbers. The tree
    in question was examined by Sir William Hooker, who gave the following
    report concerning it, which bears out strongly the fact of its having
    grown <i lang="la">in situ</i>.</p>

  <p>“The piece of wood brought by Sir Edward Belcher from the shores of
    Wellington Channel belongs to a species of pine, probably to the <i>Pinus
    (Abies) alba</i>, the most northern conifer. The structure of the wood
    of the specimen brought home differs remarkably in its anatomical
    character from that of any other conifer with which I am acquainted.
    Each concentric ring (or annual growth) consists of two zones of
    tissue; one, the outer, that towards the circumference, is broader, of
    a pale colour, and consists of ordinary tubes of fibres of wood, marked
    with discs common to all coniferæ. These discs are usually opposite
    one another when more than one row of them occur in the direction of
    the length of the fibre; and, what is very unusual, present radiating
    lines from the central depression to the circumference. Secondly,
    the inner zone of each annual ring of wood is narrower, of a dark
    colour, and formed of more slender woody fibres, with thicker walls in
    proportion to their diameter. These tubes have few or no discs upon
    them, but are covered with spiral striæ, giving the appearance of each
    tube being formed of a twisted band. The above characters prevail in
    all parts of the wood, but are slightly modified in different rings.
    Thus the outer zone is broader in some than in others, the disc-bearing
    fibres of the outer zone are sometimes faintly marked with spiral
    striæ, and the spirally marked fibres of the inner zone sometimes bear
    discs. These appearances suggest the annual recurrence of some special
    cause that shall thus modify the first and last formed fibres of each
    year’s deposit, so that that first formed may differ in amount as
    well as in kind from that last formed; and the peculiar conditions of
    an arctic climate appear to afford an adequate solution. The inner,
    or first-formed zone, must be regarded as imperfectly developed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
    being deposited at a season when the functions of the plant are very
    intermittently exercised, and when a few short hours of sunshine are
    daily succeeded by many of extreme cold. As the season advances the
    sun’s heat and light are continuous during the greater part of the
    twenty-four hours, and the newly formed wood fibres are hence more
    perfectly developed, they are much longer, present no signs of striæ,
    but are studded with discs of a more highly organized structure than
    are usual in the natural order to which this tree belongs.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

  <p>Another circumstance which shows that the tree had grown where it was
    found is the fact that in digging up the roots portions of the leaves
    were obtained. It may also be mentioned that near this place was found
    an old river channel cut deeply into the rock, which, at some remote
    period, when the climate must have been less rigorous than at present,
    had been occupied by a river of considerable size.</p>

  <p>Now, it is evident that if a tree could have grown at Wellington Sound,
    there is no reason why one might not have grown at Banks’s Land, or
    at Prince Patrick’s Island. And, if the climatic condition of the
    country would allow one tree to grow, it would equally as well allow
    a hundred, a thousand, or a whole forest. If this, then, be the case,
    Sir Roderick’s objection to the theory of growth <i lang="la">in situ</i> falls to the
    ground.</p>

  <p>Another circumstance which favours the idea that those trees grew
    during the glacial epoch is the fact that although they are recent,
    geologically speaking, and belong to the drift series, yet they are,
    historically speaking, very old. The wood, though not fossilized, is so
    hardened and changed by age that it will scarcely burn.</p>

  <p><em>Two Reasons why so little is known of former Glacial Epochs.</em>—If the
    glacial epoch resulted from the causes discussed in the foregoing
    chapters, then such epochs must have frequently supervened. We may,
    therefore, now proceed to consider what evidence there is for the
    former occurrence of excessive conditions of climate during previous
    geological ages. When we begin our inquiry, however, we soon find
    that the facts which have been recorded as evidence in favour of the
    action of ice in former geological epochs are very scanty indeed. Two
    obvious reasons for this may be given, namely, (1) The imperfection
    of the geological records themselves, and (2) the little attention
    hitherto paid toward researches of this kind. The notion, once so
    prevalent, that the climate of our earth was much warmer in the earlier
    geological ages than it is now, and that it has ever since been
    gradually becoming cooler, was wholly at variance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> with the idea of
    former ice-periods. And this conviction of the <i lang="la">à priori</i> improbability
    of cold periods having obtained during Palæozoic and Mesozoic ages
    tended to prevent due attention being paid to such facts as seemed to
    bear upon the subject. But our limited knowledge of former glacial
    epochs must no doubt be attributed chiefly to the actual imperfection
    of the geological records. So great is this imperfection that the mere
    absence of direct geological evidence cannot reasonably be regarded as
    sufficient proof that the conclusions derived from astronomical and
    physical considerations regarding former ice-periods are improbable.
    Nor is this all. The geological records of ancient glacial conditions
    are not only imperfect, but, as I shall endeavour to show, this
    imperfection <em>follows as a natural consequence from the principles of
    geology itself</em>. There are not merely so many blanks or gaps in the
    records, but a reason exists in the very nature of geological evidence
    why such breaks in the record might reasonably be expected to occur.</p>

  <p><em>Evidence of Glaciation to be found chiefly on Land-surfaces.</em>—It is on
    a land-surface that the principal traces of the action of ice during
    a glacial epoch are left, for it is there that the stones are chiefly
    striated, the rocks ground down, and the boulder clay formed. But where
    are all our ancient land-surfaces? They are not to be found. The total
    thickness of the stratified rocks of Great Britain is, according to
    Professor Ramsay, nearly fourteen miles. But from the top to the bottom
    of this enormous pile of deposits there is hardly a single land-surface
    to be detected. True patches of old land-surfaces of a local character
    exist, such, for example, as the dirt-beds of Portland; but, with the
    exception of coal-seams, every general formation from top to bottom
    has been accumulated under water, and none but the under-clays <em>ever
    existed as a land</em>-surface. And it is here, in such a formation,
    that the geologist has to collect all his information regarding the
    existence of former glacial epochs. The entire stratified rocks of the
    globe, with the exception of the coal-beds and under-clays (in neither
    of which would one expect to find traces of ice-action), consist almost
    entirely of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> <em>series of old sea-bottoms</em>, with here and there an
    occasional freshwater deposit. Bearing this in mind, what is the sort
    of evidence which we can now hope to find in these old sea-bottoms of
    the existence of former ice-periods?</p>

  <p>Every geologist of course admits that the stratified rocks are not
    old land-surfaces, but a series of old sea-bottoms formed out of
    the accumulated material derived from the degradation of primeval
    land-surfaces. And it is true that all land-surfaces once existed
    as sea-bottoms; but the stratified rocks consist of a series of old
    sea-bottoms which never were land-surfaces. Many of them no doubt
    have been repeatedly above the sea-level, and may once have possessed
    land-surfaces; but these, with the exception of the under-clays of the
    various coal measures, the dirt-beds of Portland, and one or two more
    patches, have all been denuded away. The important bearing which this
    consideration has on the nature of the evidence which we can now expect
    to find of the existence of former glacial epochs has certainly been
    very much overlooked.</p>

  <p>If we examine the matter fully we shall be led to conclude that the
    <em>transformation of a land-surface into a sea-bottom</em> will probably
    completely obliterate every trace of glaciation which that land-surface
    may once have presented. We cannot, for example, expect to meet with
    polished and striated stones belonging to a former land glaciation; for
    such stones are not carried down bodily and unchanged by our rivers
    and deposited in the sea. They become broken up by subaërial agencies
    into gravel, sand, and clay, and in this condition are transported
    seawards. Nor even if we supposed it possible that the stones and
    boulders derived from a mass of till could be carried down to sea by
    river-action, could we at the same time fail to admit that such stones
    would be deprived of all their ice-markings, and become water-worn and
    rounded on the way.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

  <p>Nor can we expect to find boulder clay among the stratified rocks, for
    boulder clay is not carried down as such and deposited in the sea, but
    under the influence of the denuding agents becomes broken up into soft
    mud, clay, sand, and gravel, as it is gradually peeled off the land and
    swept seawards. Patches of boulder clay may have been now and again
    forced into the sea by ice and eventually become covered up; but such
    cases are wholly exceptional, and their absence in any formation cannot
    fairly be adduced as a proof that that formation does not belong to a
    glacial period.</p>

  <p>The only evidence of the existence of land-ice during former periods
    which we can reasonably expect to meet with in the stratified rocks,
    consists of erratic blocks which may have been transported by icebergs
    and dropped into the sea. But unless the glaciers of such epochs
    reached the sea, we could not possibly possess even this evidence.
    Traces in the stratified rocks of the effects of land-ice during former
    epochs must, in the very nature of things, be rare indeed. The only
    sort of evidence which, as a general rule, we may expect to detect,
    is the presence of large erratic blocks imbedded in strata which from
    their constitution have evidently been formed in still water. But this
    is quite enough; for it proves the existence of ice at the time the
    strata were being deposited as conclusively as though we saw the ice
    floating with the blocks upon it. This sort of evidence, when found in
    low latitudes, ought to be received as conclusive of the existence of
    former glacial epochs; and, no doubt, would have been so received had
    it not been for the idea that, if these blocks had been transported
    by ice, there ought in addition to have been found striated stones,
    boulder clay, and other indications of the agency of land-ice.</p>

  <p>Of course all erratics are not necessarily transported by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>masses of
    ice broken from the terminal front of glaciers. The “ice foot,” formed
    by the freezing of the sea along the coasts of the higher latitudes of
    Greenland, carries seawards immense quantities of blocks and <i lang="fr">débris</i>.
    And again stones and boulders are frequently frozen into river-ice,
    and when the ice breaks up in spring are swept out to sea, and may be
    carried some little distance before they are dropped. But both these
    cases can occur only in regions where the winters are excessive; nor
    is it at all likely that such ice-rafts will succeed in making a long
    voyage. If, therefore, we could assure ourselves that the erratics
    occasionally met with in certain old geological formations in low
    latitudes were really transported from the land by an ice-foot or a
    raft of river-ice, we should be forced to conclude that very severe
    climatic conditions must have obtained in such latitudes at the time
    the erratics were dispersed.</p>

  <p>The reason why we now have, comparatively speaking, so little direct
    evidence of the existence of former glacial periods will be more
    forcibly impressed upon the mind, if we reflect on how difficult it
    would be in a million or so of years hence to find any trace of what
    we now call the glacial epoch. The striated stones would by that time
    be all, or nearly all, disintegrated, and the till washed away and
    deposited in the bottom of the sea as stratified sands and clays. And
    when these became consolidated into rock and were raised into dry land,
    the only evidence that we should probably then have that there ever
    had been a glacial epoch would be the presence of large blocks of the
    older rocks, which would be found imbedded in the upraised formation.
    We could only infer that there had been ice at work from the fact that
    by no other known agency could we conceive such blocks to have been
    transported and dropped in a still sea.</p>

  <p>Probably few geologists believe that during the Middle Eocene and
    the Upper Miocene periods our country passed through a condition of
    glaciation as severe as it has done during the Post-pliocene period;
    yet when we examine the subject carefully, we find that there is
    actually no just ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> to conclude that it has not. For, in all
    probability, throughout the strata to be eventually formed out of the
    destruction of the now existing land-surfaces, evidence of ice-action
    will be as scarce as in Eocene or Miocene strata.</p>

  <p>If the stratified rocks forming the earth’s crust consisted of a series
    of old land-surfaces instead (as they actually do) of a series of old
    sea-bottoms, then probably traces of many glacial periods might be
    detected.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the evidence which we have regarding the glacial epoch
    has been derived from what we find on the now existing land-surfaces
    of the globe. But probably not a vestige of this will exist in the
    stratified beds of future ages, formed out of the destruction of the
    present land-surfaces. Even the very arctic shell-beds themselves,
    which have afforded to the geologist such clear proofs of a frozen sea
    during the glacial epoch, will not be found in those stratified rocks;
    for they must suffer destruction along with everything else which now
    exists above the sea-level. There is probably not a single relic of
    the glacial epoch which has ever been seen by the eye of man that will
    be treasured up in the stratified rocks of future ages. Nothing that
    does not lie buried in the deeper recesses of the ocean will escape
    complete disintegration and appear imbedded in those formations. It
    is only those objects which lie in our existing sea-bottoms that will
    remain as monuments of the glacial epoch of the Post-tertiary period.
    And, moreover, it will only be those portions of the sea-bottoms that
    may happen to be upraised into dry land that will be available to the
    geologist of future ages. The point to be determined now is this:—<em>Is
    it probable that the geologist of the future will find in the rocks
    formed out of the now existing sea-bottoms more evidence of a glacial
    epoch during Post-tertiary times than we now do of one during, say, the
    Miocene, the Eocene, or the Permian period?</em> Unless this can be proved
    to be the case, we have no ground whatever to conclude that the cold
    periods of the Miocene, Eocene, and Permian periods were not as severe
    as that of the glacial epoch. This is evident, for the only relics
    which now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> remain of the glacial epochs of those periods are simply
    what happened to be protected in the then existing sea-bottoms. Every
    vestige that lay on the land would in all probability be destroyed by
    subaërial agency and carried into the sea in a sedimentary form. But
    before we can determine whether or not there is more evidence of the
    glacial epoch in our now existing sea-bottoms than there is of former
    glacial epochs in the stratified rocks (which are in reality the
    sea-bottoms belonging to ancient epochs), we must first ascertain what
    is the nature of those marks of glaciation which are to be found in a
    sea-bottom.</p>

  <p><em>Icebergs do not striate the Sea-bottom.</em>—We know that the rocky face
    of the country was ground down and striated during the glacial epoch;
    and this is now generally believed to have been done by land-ice. But
    we have no direct evidence that the floor of the ocean, beyond where it
    may have been covered with land-ice, was striated. Beyond the limits
    of the land-ice it could be striated only by means of icebergs. But
    do icebergs striate the rocky bed of the ocean? Are they adapted for
    such work? It seems to be often assumed that they are. But I have been
    totally unable to find any rational grounds for such a belief. Clean
    ice can have but little or no erosive power, and never could scratch a
    rock. To do this it must have grinding materials in the form of sand,
    mud, or stones. But the bottoms of icebergs are devoid of all such
    materials. Icebergs carry the grinding materials on their backs, not on
    their bottoms. No doubt, when the iceberg is launched into the deep,
    great masses of sand, mud, and stones will be adhering to its bottom.
    But no sooner is the berg immersed, than a melting process commences
    at its sides and lower surface in contact with the water; and the
    consequence is, the materials adhering to the lower surface soon drop
    off and sink to the bottom of the sea. The iceberg, divested of these
    materials, can now do very little harm to the rocky sea-bottom over
    which it floats. It is true that an iceberg moving with a velocity
    of a few miles an hour, if it came in contact with the sea-bottom,
    would, by the mere force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> of concussion, tear up loose and disjointed
    rocks, and hurl some of the loose materials to a distance; but it would
    do but little in the way of grinding down the rock against which it
    struck. But even supposing the bottom of the iceberg were properly
    shod with the necessary grinding materials, still it would be but a
    very inefficient grinding agent; for a <em>floating</em> iceberg would not
    be in contact with the sea-bottom. And if it were in contact with the
    sea-bottom, it would soon become stranded and, of course, motionless,
    and under such conditions could produce no effect.</p>

  <p>It is perfectly true that although the bottom of the berg may be devoid
    of grinding materials, yet these may be found lying on the surface
    of the submarine rock over which the ice moves. But it must be borne
    in mind that the same current which will move the icebergs over the
    surface of the rock will move the sand, mud, and other materials
    over it also; so that the markings effected by the ice would in all
    probability be erased by the current. In the deep recesses of the
    ocean the water has been found to have but little or no motion. But
    icebergs always follow the path of currents; and it is very evident
    that at the comparatively small depth of a thousand feet or so reached
    by icebergs the motion of the water will be considerable; and the
    continual shifting of the small particles of the mud and sand will in
    all probability efface the markings which may be made now and again by
    a passing berg.</p>

  <p>Much has been said regarding the superiority of icebergs as grinding
    and striating agents in consequence of the great velocity of their
    motion in comparison with that of land-ice. But it must be remembered
    that it is while the iceberg is floating, and before it touches the
    rock, that it possesses high velocity. When the iceberg runs aground,
    its motion is suddenly arrested or greatly reduced. But if the iceberg
    advancing upon a sloping sea-bottom is raised up so as to exert great
    pressure, it will on this account be the more suddenly arrested,
    the motion will be slow, and the distance passed over short, before
    the berg becomes stranded. If it exerts but little pressure on the
    sea-bottom, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>it may retain a considerable amount of motion and advance
    to a considerable distance before it is brought to a stand; but,
    exerting little pressure, it can perform but little work. Land-ice
    moves slowly, but then it exerts enormous pressure. A glacier 1,000
    feet in thickness has a pressure on its rocky bed equal to about 25
    tons on the square foot; but an iceberg a mile in thickness, forced up
    on a sloping sea-bottom to an elevation of 20 feet (and this is perhaps
    more than any ocean-current could effect), would only exert a pressure
    of about half a ton on the square foot, or about 1/50th part of the
    pressure of the glacier 1,000 feet in thickness. A great deal has been
    said about the erosive and crushing power of icebergs of enormous
    thickness, as if their thickness gave them any additional pressure. An
    iceberg 100 feet in thickness will exert just as much pressure as one
    a mile in thickness. The pressure of an iceberg is not like that of a
    glacier, in proportion to its thickness, but to the height to which it
    is raised out of the water. An iceberg 100 feet in thickness raised 10
    feet will exert exactly the same pressure as one a mile in thickness
    raised to an equal height.</p>

  <p>To be an efficient grinding agent, steadiness of motion, as well as
    pressure, is essential. A rolling or rocking motion is ill-adapted
    for grinding down and striating a rock. A steady rubbing motion under
    pressure is the thing required. But an iceberg is not only deficient in
    pressure, but also deficient in steadiness of motion. When an iceberg
    moving with considerable velocity comes on an elevated portion of the
    sea-bottom, it does not move steadily onwards over the rock, unless
    the pressure of the berg on the rock be trifling. The resistance being
    entirely at the bottom of the iceberg, its momentum, combined with the
    pressure of the current, applied wholly above the point of resistance,
    tends to make the berg bend forward, and in some cases upset (when
    it is of a cubical form). The momentum of the moving berg, instead
    of being applied in forcing it over the rock against which it comes
    in contact, is probably all consumed in work against gravitation in
    raising the berg upon its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span> front edge. After the momentum is consumed,
    unless the berg be completely upset, it will fall back under the force
    of gravitation to its original position. But the momentum which it
    acquires from gravitation in falling backwards carries it beyond its
    position of repose in an opposite direction. It will thus continue to
    rock backwards and forwards until the friction of the water brings it
    to rest. The momentum of the berg, instead of being applied to the work
    of grinding and striating the sea-bottom, will chiefly be consumed in
    heat in the agitation of the water. But if the berg does advance, it
    will do so with a rocking unsteady motion, which, as Mr. Couthouy<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
    and Professor Dana<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> observe, will tend rather to obliterate
    striations than produce them.</p>

  <p>A floating berg moves with great steadiness; but a berg that has run
    aground cannot advance with a steady motion. If the rock over which the
    berg moves offers little resistance, it may do so; but in such a case
    the berg could produce but little effect on the rock.</p>

  <p>Dr. Sutherland, who has had good opportunities to witness the effects
    of icebergs, makes some most judicious remarks on the subject. “It
    will be well” he says, “to bear in mind that when an iceberg <em>touches
    the ground, if that ground be hard and resisting, it must come to a
    stand</em>, and the propelling power continuing, a slight leaning over in
    the water, or yielding motion of the whole mass, may compensate readily
    for being so suddenly arrested. If, however, the ground be soft, so
    as not to arrest the motion of the iceberg at once, a moraine will be
    the result; but the moraine thus raised will tend to bring it to a
    stand.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

  <p>There is another cause referred to by Professor Dana, which, to a
    great extent, must prevent the iceberg from having an opportunity of
    striating the sea-bottom, even though it were otherwise well adapted
    for so doing. It is this: the bed of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>ocean in the track of
    icebergs must be pretty much covered with stones and rubbish dropped
    from the melting bergs. And this mass of rubbish will tend to protect
    the rock.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

  <p>If icebergs cannot be shown <i lang="la">à priori</i>, from mechanical considerations,
    to be well adapted for striating the sea-bottom, one would naturally
    expect, from the confident way in which it is asserted that they are
    so adapted, that the fact has been at least established by actual
    observation. But, strange as it may appear, we seem to have little or
    no proof that icebergs actually striate the bed of the ocean. This can
    be proved from the direct testimony of the advocates of the iceberg
    theory themselves.</p>

  <p>We shall take the testimony of Mr. Campbell, the author of two
    well-known works in defence of the iceberg theory, viz., “Frost and
    Fire,” and “A Short American Tramp.” Mr. Campbell went in the fall of
    the year 1864 to the coast of Labrador, the Straits of Belle Isle, and
    the Gulf of St. Lawrence, for the express purpose of witnessing the
    effects of icebergs, and testing the theory which he had formed, that
    the ice-markings of the glacial epoch were caused by floating ice and
    not by land-ice, as is now generally believed.</p>

  <p>The following is the result of his observations on the coast of
    Labrador.</p>

  <p>Hanly Harbour, Strait of Belle Isle:—“The water is 37° F. in July....
    As fast as one island of ice grounds and bursts, another takes its
    place; and in winter the whole strait is blocked up by a mass which
    swings bodily up and down, grating along the bottom at all depths....
    Examined the beaches and rocks at the water-line, especially in sounds.
    Found the rocks ground smooth, <em>but not striated</em>, in the sounds”
    (<cite>Short American Tramp</cite>, pp. 68, 107).</p>

  <p>Cape Charles and Battle Harbour:—“But though these harbours are all
    frozen every winter, the <em>rocks at the water-line are not striated</em>”
    (p. 68).</p>

  <p>At St. Francis Harbour:—“The water-line is much rubbed, smooth, <em>but
    not striated</em>” (p. 72).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

  <p>Cape Bluff:—“Watched the rocks with a telescope, and <em>failed to make
    out striæ anywhere</em>; but the water-line is everywhere rubbed smooth”
    (p. 75).</p>

  <p>Seal Islands:—“<em>No striæ are to be seen at the land-wash in these
    sounds or on open sea-coasts near the present water-line</em>” (p. 76).</p>

  <p>He only mentions having here found striations in the three following
    places along the entire coast of Labrador visited by him; and in regard
    to two of these, it seems very doubtful that the markings were made by
    modern icebergs.</p>

  <p>Murray’s Harbour:—“This harbour was blocked up with ice on the 20th of
    July. The water-line is rubbed, and in <em>some places</em> striated” (p. 69).</p>

  <p>Pack Island:—“The water-line in a narrow sound was polished and
    striated in the direction of the sound, about N.N.W. This seems to be
    fresh work done by heavy ice drifting from Sandwich Bay; <em>but, on the
    other hand, stages with their legs in the sea, and resting on these
    very rocks, are not swept away by the ice</em>” (p. 96). If these markings
    were modern, why did not the “heavy ice” remove the small fir poles
    supporting the fishing-stages?</p>

  <p>Red Bay:—“Landed half-dressed, and found some striæ perfectly fresh at
    the water-level, but weathered out a short distance <em>inland</em>” (p. 107).
    The striations “inland” could not have been made by modern icebergs;
    and it does not follow that because the markings at the water-level
    were not weathered they were produced by modern ice.</p>

  <p>These are the evidences which he found that icebergs striate rocks,
    on a coast of which he says that, during the year he visited it, “the
    winter-drift was one vast solid raft of floes and bergs more than 150
    miles wide, and perhaps 3,000 feet thick at spots, driven by a whole
    current bodily over one definite course, year after year, since this
    land was found” (p. 85).</p>

  <p>But Mr. Campbell himself freely admits that the floating ice which
    comes aground along the shores does not produce striæ. “It is
    sufficiently evident,” he says, “<em>that glacial striæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> are not produced
    by thin bay-ice</em>” (p. 76). And in “Frost and Fire,” vol. ii., p. 237,
    he states that, “from a careful examination of the water-line at many
    spots, it appears that bay-ice grinds rocks, <em>but does not produce
    striation</em>.”</p>

  <p>“It is impossible,” he continues, “to get at rocks over which heavy
    icebergs now move; but a mass 150 miles wide, perhaps 3,000 feet thick
    in some parts, and moving at the rate of a mile an hour, or more,
    <em>appears to be an engine amply sufficient</em> to account for striæ on
    rising rocks.” And in “American Tramp,” p. 76, he says, “<em>striæ must be
    made</em> in deep water by the large masses which seem to pursue the even
    tenor of their way in the steady current which flows down the coast.”</p>

  <p>Mr. Campbell, from a careful examination of the sea-bottom along the
    coast, finds that the small icebergs do not produce striæ, but the
    large ones, which move over rocks impossible to be got at, “must”
    produce them. They “appear” to be amply sufficient to do so. If the
    smaller bergs cannot striate the sea-bottom, why must the larger ones
    do so? There is no reason why the smaller bergs should not move as
    swiftly and exert as much pressure on the sea-bottom as the larger
    ones. And even supposing that they did not, one would expect that the
    light bergs would effect on a smaller scale what the heavy ones would
    do on a larger.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that when Mr. Campbell visited Labrador he expected to
    find the sea-coast under the water-line striated by means of icebergs,
    and was probably not a little surprised to find that it actually was
    not. And I have no doubt that were the sea-bottom in the tracks of the
    large icebergs elevated into view, he would find to his surprise that
    it was free from striations also.</p>

  <p>So far as observation is concerned, we have no grounds from what Mr.
    Campbell witnessed to conclude that icebergs striate the sea-bottom.</p>

  <p>The testimony of Dr. Sutherland, who has had opportunities of seeing
    the effects of icebergs in arctic regions, leads us to the same
    conclusion. “Except,” he says, “from the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> afforded by plants
    and animals at the bottom, we have <em>no means whatever</em> to ascertain
    the effect produced by icebergs upon the rocks.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In the Malegat
    and Waigat I have seen whole clusters of these floating islands,
    drawing from 100 to 250 fathoms, moving to and fro with every return
    and recession of the tides. I looked very earnestly for grooves and
    scratches left by icebergs and glaciers in the rocks, but always failed
    to discover any.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

  <p>We shall now see whether river-ice actually produces striations or not.
    If floating ice under any form can striate rocks, one would expect that
    it ought to be done by river-ice, seeing that such ice is obliged to
    follow one narrow definite track.</p>

  <p>St. John’s River, New Brunswick:—“This river,” says Mr. Campbell,
    “is obstructed by ice during five months of the year. When the ice
    goes, there is wild work on the bank. Arrived at St. John, drove
    to the suspension-bridge.... At this spot, if <em>anywhere in the
    world</em>, river-ice ought to produce striation. The whole drainage of
    a wide basin and one of the strongest tides in the world, here work
    continually in one rock-groove; and in winter this water-power is armed
    with heavy ice. <em>There are no striæ</em> about the water-line.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

  <p>River St. Lawrence:—“In winter the power of ice-floats driven by
    water-power is tremendous. The river freezes and packs ice till
    the flow of water is obstructed. The rock-pass at Quebec is like
    the Narrows at St. John’s, Newfoundland. The whole pass, about a
    mile wide, was paved with great broken slabs and round boulders of
    worn ice as big as small shacks, piled and tossed, and heaped and
    scattered upon the level water below and frozen solid.... This kind
    of ice does <span class="smcap">not</span> <em>produce striation</em> at the water-margin at
    Quebec. At Montreal, when the river ‘goes,’ the ice goes with it
    with a vengeance.... The <em>piers are not yet striated</em> by river-ice
    at Montreal.... The rocks at the high-water level have <em>no trace</em> of
    glacial striæ.... The rock at Ottawa is rubbed by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>river-ice every
    spring, and <em>always in one direction, but it is not striated</em>....
    The surfaces are all rubbed smooth, and the edges of broken beds are
    rounded where exposed to the ice; <em>but there are no striæ</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

  <p>When Sir Charles Lyell visited the St. Lawrence in 1842, at Quebec he
    went along with Colonel Codrington “and searched carefully below the
    city in the channel of the St. Lawrence, at low water, near the shore,
    for the signs of glacial action at the precise point where the chief
    pressure and friction of packed ice are exerted every year,” but found
    none.</p>

  <p>“At the bridge above the Falls of Montmorenci, over which a large
    quantity of ice passes every year, the gneiss is polished, and kept
    perfectly free from lichens, but not more so than rocks similarly
    situated at waterfalls in Scotland. In none of these places were any
    long straight grooves observable.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

  <p>The only thing in the shape of modern ice-markings which he seems to
    have met with in North America was a few straight furrows half an inch
    broad in soft sandstone, at the base of a cliff at Cape Blomidon in the
    Bay of Fundy, at a place where during the preceding winter “packed”
    ice 15 feet thick had been pushed along when the tide rose over the
    sandstone ledges.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

  <p>The very fact that a geologist so eminent as Sir Charles Lyell, after
    having twice visited North America, and searched specially for modern
    ice-markings, was able to find only two or three scratches, upon a soft
    sandstone rock, which he could reasonably attribute to floating ice,
    ought to have aroused the suspicion of the advocates of the iceberg
    theory that they had really formed too extravagant notions regarding
    the potency of floating ice as a striating agent.</p>

  <p>There is no reason to believe that the grooves and markings noticed
    by M. Weibye and others on the Scandinavian coast and other parts of
    northern Europe were made by icebergs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

  <p>Professor Geikie has clearly shown, from the character and direction
    of the markings, that they are the production of land-ice.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> If
    the floating ice of the St. Lawrence and the icebergs of Labrador are
    unable to striate and groove the rocks, it is not likely that those of
    northern Europe will be able to do so.</p>

  <p>It will not do for the advocates of the iceberg theory to assume, as
    they have hitherto done, that, as a matter of course, the sea-bottom is
    being striated and grooved by means of icebergs. They must prove that.
    They must either show that, as a matter of fact, icebergs are actually
    efficient agents in striating the sea-bottom, or prove from mechanical
    principles that they must be so. The question must be settled either by
    observation or by reason; mere opinion will not do.</p>

  <p><em>The Amount of Material transported by Icebergs much exaggerated.</em>—The
    transporting of boulders and rubbish, and not the grinding and
    striating of rocks, is evidently the proper function of the iceberg.
    But even in this respect I fear too much has been attributed to it.</p>

  <p>In reading the details of voyages in the arctic regions one cannot help
    feeling surprised how seldom reference is made to stones and rubbish
    being seen on icebergs. Arctic voyagers, like other people, when they
    are alluding to the geological effects of icebergs, speak of enormous
    quantities of stones being transported by them; but in reading the
    details of their voyages, the impression conveyed is that icebergs with
    stones and blocks of rock upon them are the exceptions. The greater
    portion of the narratives of voyages in arctic regions consists of
    interesting and detailed accounts of the voyager’s adventures among the
    ice. The general appearance of the icebergs, their shape, their size,
    their height, their colour, are all noticed; but rarely is mention
    made of stones being seen. That the greater number of icebergs have
    no stones or rubbish on them is borne out by the positive evidence of
    geologists who have had opportunities of seeing icebergs.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campbell says:—“It is remarkable that up to this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>time we have only
    seen a few doubtful stones on bergs which we have passed.... Though
    no bergs with stones <em>on them or in them</em> have been approached during
    this voyage, many on board the <cite>Ariel</cite> have been close to bergs heavily
    laden.... A man who has had some experience of ice has <em>never seen a
    stone on a berg</em> in these latitudes. Captain Anderson, of the <cite>Europa</cite>,
    who is a geologist, has <em>never seen a stone on a berg</em> in crossing the
    Atlantic. <em>No stones were clearly seen on this trip.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Captain Sir
    James Anderson (who has long been familiar with geology, has spent a
    considerable part of his life on the Atlantic, and has been accustomed
    to view the iceberg as a geologist as well as a seaman) has never seen
    a stone on an iceberg in the Atlantic. This is rather a significant
    fact.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Lyell states that, when passing icebergs on the Atlantic,
    he “was most anxious to ascertain whether there was any mud, stones,
    or fragments of rocks on any one of these floating masses; but after
    examining about forty of them without perceiving any signs of frozen
    matter, I left the deck when it was growing dusk.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> After he had
    gone below, one was said to be seen with something like stones upon it.
    The captain and officers of the ship assured him that they had <em>never
    seen a stone upon a berg</em>.</p>

  <p>The following extract from Mr. Packard’s “Memoir on the Glacial
    Phenomena of Labrador and Maine,” will show how little is effected by
    the great masses of floating ice on the Labrador coast either in the
    way of grinding and striating the rocks, or of transporting stones,
    clay, and other materials.</p>

  <p>“Upon this coast, which during the summer of 1864 was lined with a
    belt of floe-ice and bergs probably two hundred miles broad, and which
    extended from the Gulf of St. Lawrence at Belles Amours to the arctic
    seas, this immense body of floating ice seemed <em>directly</em> to produce
    but little alteration in its physical features. If we were to ascribe
    the grooving and polishing of rocks to the action of floating ice-floes
    and bergs, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>how is it that the present shores far above (500), and at
    least 250 feet below, the water-line are often jagged and angular,
    though constantly stopping the course of masses of ice impelled four to
    six miles an hour by the joint action of tides, currents, and winds? No
    boulders, or gravel, or mud were seen upon any of the bergs or masses
    of shore-ice. They had dropped all burdens of this nature nearer their
    points of detachment in the high arctic regions.” ...</p>

  <p>“This huge area of floating ice, embracing so many thousands of square
    miles, was of greater extent, and remained longer upon the coast, in
    1864, than for forty years previous. It was not only pressed upon the
    coast by the normal action of the Labrador and Greenland currents,
    which, in consequence of the rotatory motion of the earth, tended to
    force the ice in a south-westerly direction, but the presence of the
    ice caused the constant passage of cooler currents of air from the
    sea over the ice upon the heated land, giving rise during the present
    season to a constant succession of north-easterly winds from March
    until early in August, which further served to crowd the ice into every
    harbour and recess upon the coast. It was the universal complaint
    of the inhabitants that the easterly winds were more prevalent, and
    the ice ‘held’ later in the harbours this year than for many seasons
    previous. Thus the fisheries were nearly a failure, and vegetation
    greatly retarded in its development. But so far as polishing and
    striating the rocks, depositing drift material, and thus modifying
    the contour of the surface of the present coast, this modern mass of
    bergs and floating ice effected comparatively little. Single icebergs,
    when small enough, entered the harbours, and there stranding, soon
    pounded to pieces upon the rocks, melted, and disappeared. From Cape
    Harrison, in lat. 55°, to Caribo Island, was an interrupted line of
    bergs stranded in 80 to 100 or more fathoms, often miles apart, while
    others passed to the seaward down by the eastern coast of Newfoundland,
    or through the Straits of Belle Isle.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

  <p><em>Boulder Clay the Product of Land-ice.</em>—There is still another point
    connected with icebergs to which we must allude, viz., the opinion
    that great masses of the boulder clay of the glacial epoch were formed
    from the droppings of icebergs. If boulder clay is at present being
    accumulated in this manner, then traces of the boulder clay deposits of
    former epochs might be expected to occur. It is perfectly obvious that
    <em>unstratified</em> boulder clay could not have been formed in this way.
    Stones, gravel, sand, clay, and mud, the ingredients of boulder clay,
    tumbled all together from the back of an iceberg, could not sink to the
    bottom of the sea without separating. The stones would reach the bottom
    first, then the gravel, then the sand, then the clay, and last of all
    the mud, and the whole would settle down in a stratified form. But,
    besides, how could the <em>clay</em> be derived from icebergs? Icebergs derive
    their materials from the land before they are launched into the deep,
    and while they are in the form of land-ice. The materials which are
    found on the backs of icebergs are what fell upon the ice from mountain
    tops and crags projecting above the ice. Icebergs are chiefly derived
    from continental ice, such as that of Greenland, where the whole
    country is buried under one continuous mass, with only a lofty mountain
    peak here and there rising above the surface. And this is no doubt
    the chief reason why so few icebergs have stones upon their backs.
    The continental ice of Greenland is not, like the glaciers of the
    Alps, covered with loose stones. Dr. Robert Brown informs me that no
    moraine matter has ever been seen on the inland ice of Greenland. It is
    perfectly plain that clay does not fall upon the ice. What falls upon
    the ice is stones, blocks of rocks, and the loose <i lang="fr">débris</i>. Clay and
    mud we know, from the accounts given by arctic voyagers, are sometimes
    washed down upon the coast-ice; but certainly very little of either can
    possibly get upon an iceberg. Arctic voyagers sometimes speak of seeing
    clay and mud upon bergs; but it is probable that if they had been near
    enough they would have found that what they took for clay and mud were
    merely dust and rubbish.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the boulder clay of many places bears unmistakable evidence
    of having been formed under water; but it does not on that account
    follow that it was formed from the droppings of icebergs. The fact
    that the boulder clay in every case <em>is chiefly composed of materials
    derived from the country on which the clay lies</em>, proves that it was
    not formed from matter transported by icebergs. The clay, no doubt,
    contains stones and boulders belonging to other countries, which in
    some cases may have been transported by icebergs; but the clay itself
    has not come from another country. But if the clay itself has been
    derived from the country on which it lies, then it is absurd to suppose
    that it was deposited from icebergs. The clay and materials which are
    found on icebergs are derived from the land on which the iceberg is
    formed; but to suppose that icebergs, after floating about upon the
    ocean, should always return to the country which gave them birth, and
    there deposit their loads, is rather an extravagant supposition.</p>

  <p>From the facts and considerations adduced we are, I would venture to
    presume, warranted to conclude that, with the exception of what may
    have been produced by land-ice, very little in the shape of boulder
    clay or striated rocks belonging to the glacial epoch lies buried
    under the ocean—and that when the now existing land-surfaces are all
    denuded, probably scarcely a trace of the glacial epoch will then be
    found, except the huge blocks that were transported by icebergs and
    dropped into the sea. It is therefore probable that we have as much
    evidence of the existence of a glacial epoch during former periods as
    the geologists of future ages will have of the existence of a glacial
    epoch during the Post-tertiary period, and that consequently we are not
    warranted in concluding that the glacial epoch was something unique in
    the geological history of our globe.</p>

  <p><em>Palæontological Evidence.</em>—It might be thought that if glacial epochs
    have been numerous, we ought to have abundance of palæontological
    evidence of their existence. I do not know if this necessarily follows.
    Let us take the glacial epoch itself for example, which is quite a
    modern affair. Here we do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> require to go and search in the bottom
    of the sea for the evidence of its existence; for we have the surface
    of the land in almost identically the same state in which it was when
    the ice left it, with the boulder clay and all the wreck of the ice
    lying upon it. But what geologist, with all these materials before him,
    would be able to find out from palæontological evidence alone that
    there had been such an epoch? He might search the whole, but would not
    be able to find fossil evidence from which he could warrantably infer
    that the country had ever been covered with ice. We have evidence
    in the fossils of the Crag and other deposits of the existence of a
    colder condition of climate prior to the true glacial period, and in
    the shell-beds of the Clyde and other places of a similar state of
    matters after the great ice-sheets had vanished away. But in regard
    to the period of the true boulder clay or till, when the country was
    enveloped in ice, palæontology has almost nothing whatever to tell
    us. “Whatever may be the cause,” says Sir Charles Lyell, “the fact is
    certain that over large areas in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, I might
    add throughout the northern hemisphere on both sides of the Atlantic,
    the stratified drift of the glacial period is very commonly devoid of
    fossils.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

  <p>In the “flysch” of the Eocene of the Alps, to which we shall have
    occasion to refer in the next chapter, in which the huge blocks are
    found which prove the existence of ice-action during that period, few
    or no fossils have been found. So devoid of organic remains is that
    formation, that it is only from its position, says Sir Charles, that
    it is known to belong to the middle or “nummulitic” portion of the
    great Eocene series. Again, in the conglomerates at Turin, belonging
    to the Upper Miocene period, in which the angular blocks of limestone
    are found which prove that during that period Alpine glaciers reached
    the sea-level in the latitude of Italy, not a single organic remain has
    been found. It would seem that an extreme paucity of organic life is a
    characteristic of a glacial period, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>which warrants us in concluding
    that the absence of organic remains in any formation otherwise
    indicative of a cold climate cannot be regarded as sufficient evidence
    that that formation does not belong to a cold period.</p>

  <p>In the last chapter it was shown why so little evidence of the warm
    periods of the glacial epoch is now forthcoming. The remains of the
    <i lang="la">faunas</i> and <i lang="la">floras</i> of those periods were nearly wholly destroyed and
    swept into the adjoining seas by the ice-sheet that covered the land.
    It is upon the present land-surface that we find the chief evidence
    of the last glacial epoch, but the traces of the warm periods of that
    epoch are hardly now to be met with in that position since they have
    nearly all been obliterated or carried into the sea.</p>

  <p>In regard to former glacial epochs, however, ice-marked rocks,
    scratched stones, moraines, till, &amp;c., no longer exist; the
    land-surfaces of those old times have been utterly swept away. The only
    evidence, therefore, of such ancient glacial epochs, that we can hope
    to detect, must be sought for in the deposits that were laid down upon
    the sea-bottom; where also we may expect to find traces of the warm
    periods that alternated during such epochs with glacial conditions. It
    is plain, moreover, that the palæontological evidence in favour of warm
    periods will always be the most abundant and satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Judging from geological evidence alone, we naturally conclude that, as
    a general rule, the climate of former periods was somewhat warmer than
    it is at the present day. It is from fossil remains that the geologist
    principally forms his estimate of the character of the climate during
    any period. Now, in regard to fossil remains, the warm periods will
    always be far better represented than the cold; for we find that, as
    a <em>general rule, those formations which geologists are inclined to
    believe indicate a cold condition of climate are remarkably devoid of
    fossil remains</em>. If a geologist does not keep this principle in view,
    he will be very apt to form a wrong estimate of the general character
    of the climate of a period of such enormous length as say the Tertiary.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

  <p>Suppose that the presently existing sea-bottoms, which have been
    forming since the commencement of the glacial epoch, were to become
    consolidated into rock and thereafter to be elevated into dry land, we
    should then have a formation which might be properly designated the
    Post-pliocene. It would represent the time which has elapsed from the
    beginning of the glacial epoch to the present day. Suppose one to be
    called upon as a geologist to determine from that formation what was
    the general character of the climate during the period in question,
    what would probably be the conclusion at which he would arrive? He
    would probably find here and there patches of boulder clay containing
    striated and ice-worn stones. Now and again he would meet with bones
    of the mammoth and the reindeer, and shells of an arctic type. He
    would likewise stumble upon huge blocks of the older rocks imbedded
    in the formation, from which he would infer the existence of icebergs
    and glaciers reaching the sea-level. But, on the whole, he would
    perceive that the greater portion of the fossil remains met with in
    this formation implied a warm and temperate condition of climate. At
    the lower part of the formation, corresponding to the time of the true
    boulder clay, there would be such a scarcity of organic remains that
    he would probably feel at a loss to say whether the climate at that
    time was cold or hot. But if the intense cold of the glacial epoch
    was not continuous, but broken up by intervening warm periods during
    which the ice, to a considerable extent at least, disappeared for a
    long period of time (and there are few geologists who have properly
    studied the subject who will positively deny that such was the case),
    then the country would no doubt during those warm periods possess an
    abundance of plant and animal life. It is quite true that we may almost
    search in vain on the present land-surface for the organic remains
    which belonged to those inter-glacial periods; for they were nearly
    all swept away by the ice which followed. But no doubt in the deep
    recesses of the ocean, buried under hundreds of feet of sand, mud,
    clay, and gravel, lie multitudes of the plants and animals which then
    flourished on the land, and were carried down by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> rivers into the sea.
    And along with these lie the skeletons, shells, and other exuviæ of
    the creatures which flourished in the warm seas of those periods. Now
    looking at the great abundance of fossils indicative of warm and genial
    conditions which the lower portions of this formation would contain,
    the geologist might be in danger of inferring that the earlier part
    of the Post-pliocene period was a warmer period, whereas we, at the
    present day, looking at the matter from a different standpoint, declare
    that part to have been characterized by cold or glacial conditions. No
    doubt, if the beds formed during the cold periods of the glacial epoch
    could be distinguished from those formed during the warm periods, the
    fossil remains of the one would indicate a cold condition of climate,
    and those of the other a warm condition; but still, taking the entire
    epoch as a whole, the percentage of fossil remains indicative of a
    warm condition would probably so much exceed that indicative of a cold
    condition, that we should come to the conclusion that the character
    of the climate, as a whole, during the epoch in question was warm and
    equable.</p>

  <p>As geologists we have, as a rule, no means of arriving at a knowledge
    of the character of the climate of any given period but through an
    examination of the sea-bottoms belonging to that period; for these
    contain all the evidence upon the subject. But unless we exercise
    caution, we shall be very apt, in judging of the climate of such
    a period, to fall into the same error that we have just now seen
    one might naturally fall into were he called upon to determine the
    character of the climate during the glacial epoch from the nature of
    the organic remains which lie buried in our adjoining seas. On this
    point Mr. J. Geikie’s observations are so appropriate, that I cannot
    do better than introduce them here. “When we are dealing,” says this
    writer, “with formations so far removed from us in time, and in which
    the animal and plant remains depart so widely from existing forms of
    life, we can hardly expect to derive much aid from the fossils in our
    attempts to detect traces of cold climatic conditions. The arctic
    shells in our Post-tertiary clays are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> convincing proofs of the former
    existence in our latitude of a severe climate; but when we go so far
    back as Palæozoic ages, we have no such clear evidence to guide us.
    All that palæontologists can say regarding the fossils belonging to
    these old times is simply this, that they seem to indicate, generally
    speaking, mild, temperate, or genial, and even sometimes tropical,
    conditions of climate. Many of the fossils, indeed, if we are to reason
    from analogy at all, could not possibly have lived in cold seas. But,
    for aught that we know, there may have been alternations of climate
    during the deposition of each particular formation; and these changes
    may be marked by the presence or absence, or by the greater or less
    abundant development, of certain organisms at various horizons in
    the strata. Notwithstanding all that has been done, our knowledge of
    the natural history of these ancient seas is still very imperfect;
    and therefore, in the present state of our information, we are not
    entitled to argue, from the general aspect of the fossils in our older
    formations, that the temperature of the ancient seas was never other
    than mild and genial.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

  <p><em>Conclusion.</em>—From what has already been stated it will, I trust, be
    apparent that, assuming glacial epochs during past geological ages to
    have been as numerous and as severe as the Secular theory demands,
    still it would be unreasonable to expect to meet with abundant traces
    of them. The imperfection of the geological record is such that we
    ought not to be astonished that so few relics of former ice ages have
    come down to us. It will also be apparent that the palæontological
    evidence of a warm condition of climate having obtained during any
    particular age, is no proof that a glacial epoch did not also supervene
    during the same cycle of time. Indeed it is quite the reverse; for
    the warm conditions of which we have proof may indicate merely the
    existence of an inter-glacial period. Furthermore, if the Secular
    theory of changes of climate be admitted, then evidence of a warm
    condition of climate having <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>prevailed in arctic regions during any
    past geological age may be regarded as presumptive proof of the
    existence of a glacial epoch; that is to say, of an epoch during
    which cold and warm conditions of climate alternated. Keeping these
    considerations in view, we shall now proceed to examine briefly what
    evidence we at present have of the former existence of glacial epochs.</p>

  <h3>CAMBRIAN PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>Island of Islay.</em>—Good evidence of ice-action has been observed by
    Mr. James Thomson, F.G.S.,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> in strata which he believes to be of
    Cambrian age. At Port Askaig, Island of Islay, below a precipitous
    cliff of quartzite 70 feet in height, there is a mass of arenaceous
    talcose schist containing fragments of granite, some angular, but
    most of them rounded, and of all sizes, from mere particles to
    large boulders. As there is no granite in the island from which
    these boulders could have been derived, he justly infers that they
    must have been transported by the agency of ice. The probability
    of his conclusion is strengthened by the almost total absence of
    stratification in the deposit in question.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

  <p><em>North-west of Scotland.</em>—Mr. J. Geikie tells me that much of the
    Cambrian conglomerate in the north-west of Scotland strongly reminds
    him of the coarse shingle beds (Alpine diluvium) which so often crowd
    the old glacial valleys of Switzerland and Northern Italy. In many
    places the stones of the Cambrian conglomerate have a subangular,
    blunted shape, like those of the re-arranged moraine débris of Alpine
    countries.</p>

  <h3>SILURIAN PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>Wigtownshire.</em>—The possibility of glacial action so far back as
    the Silurian age has been suggested. In beds of slate and shales in
    Wigtownshire of Lower Silurian age Mr. J. Carrick Moore found beds of
    conglomerate of a remarkable character. The fragments generally vary
    from the size of one inch to a foot in diameter, but in some of the
    beds, boulders of 3, 4, and even 5 feet in diameter occur. There are
    no rocks in the neighbourhood from which any of these fragments could
    have been derived. The matrix of this conglomerate is sometimes a green
    trappean-looking sandstone of exceeding toughness, and sometimes an
    indurated sandstone indistinguishable from many common varieties of
    greywacke.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

  <p><em>Ayrshire.</em>—Mr. James Geikie states that in Glenapp, and near
    Dalmellington, he found embedded in Lower Silurian strata blocks
    and boulders from one foot to 5 feet in diameter of gneiss,
    syenite, granite, &amp;c., none of which belong to rocks of those
    neighbourhoods.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Similar cases have been found in Galway, Ireland,
    and at Lisbellaw, south of Enniskillen.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> In America, Professor
    Dawson describes Silurian conglomerates with boulders 2 feet in
    diameter.</p>

  <p><em>Arctic Regions.</em>—The existence of warm inter-glacial periods
    during that age may be inferred from the fact that in the arctic
    regions we find widespread masses of Silurian limestones containing
    encrinites, corals, and mollusca, and other fossil <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>remains, for an
    account of which see Professor Haughton’s geological account of the
    Arctic Archipelago appended to McClintock’s “Narrative of Arctic
    Discoveries.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

  <h3>OLD RED SANDSTONE.</h3>

  <p><em>North of England.</em>—According to Professor Ramsay and some other
    geologists the brecciated, subangular conglomerates and boulder beds
    of the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland and the North of England are of
    glacial origin. When these conglomerates and the recent boulder clay
    come together it is difficult to draw the line of demarcation between
    them.</p>

  <p>Professor Ramsay observed some very remarkable facts in connection
    with the Old Red Sandstone conglomerates of Kirkby Lonsdale, and
    Sedburgh, in Westmoreland and Yorkshire. I shall give the results of
    his observations in his own words.</p>

  <p>“The result is, that we have found many stones and blocks distinctly
    scratched, and on others the ghosts of scratches nearly obliterated
    by age and chemical action, probably aided by pressure at a time when
    these rocks were buried under thousands of feet of carboniferous
    strata. In some cases, however, the markings were probably produced
    within the body of the rock itself by pressure, accompanied by
    disturbance of the strata; but in others the longitudinal and cross
    striations convey the idea of glacial action. The shapes of the stones
    of these conglomerates, many of which are from 2 to 3 feet long, their
    flattened sides and subangular edges, together with the confused manner
    in which they are often arranged (like stones in the drift), have
    long been enough to convince me of their ice-borne character; and the
    scratched specimens, when properly investigated, may possibly convince
    others.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

  <p><em>Isle of Man.</em>—The conglomerate of the Old Red Sandstone in the Isle of
    Man has been compared by Mr. Cumming to “a consolidated ancient boulder
    clay.” And he remarks, “Was it so that those strange trilobitic-looking
    fishes of that era had to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>endure the buffeting of ice-waves, and to
    struggle amidst the wreck of ice-floes and the crush of bergs?”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

  <p><em>Australia.</em>—A conglomerate similar to that of Scotland has been found
    in Victoria, Australia, by Mr. Selwyn, at several localities. Along
    the Wild Duck Creek, near Heathcote, and also near the Mia-Mia, Spring
    Plains, Redesdale, localities in the Colony of Victoria, where it was
    examined by Messrs. Taylor and Etheridge, Junior, this conglomerate
    consists of a mixture of granite pebbles and boulders of various
    colours and textures, porphyries, indurated sandstone, quartz, and
    a peculiar flint-coloured rock in a matrix of bluish-grey very hard
    mud-cement.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Rocks similar to the pebbles and blocks composing the
    conglomerate do not occur in the immediate neighbourhood; and from the
    curious mixture of large and small angular and water-worn fragments
    it was conjectured that it might possibly be of glacial origin.
    Scratched stones were not observed, although a careful examination was
    made. From similar mud-pebble beds on the Lerderderg River, Victoria,
    Mr. P. Daintree obtained a few pebbles grooved after the manner of
    ice-scratched blocks.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

  <p>And the existence of a warm condition of climate during the Old Red
    Sandstone period is evidenced by the fossiliferous limestones of
    England, Russia, and America. On the banks of the Athabasca River,
    Rupert-Land, Sir John Richardson found beds of limestone containing
    <i>Producti</i>, <i>Spiriferi</i>, an <i>Orthis</i> resembling <i>O. resupinata</i>,
    <i>Terebratula reticularis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and a <i>Pleurotomaria</i>, which, in the
    opinion of the late Dr. Woodward, who examined the specimens, are
    characteristic of Devonian rocks of Devonshire.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

  <h3>CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>France.</em>—It is now a good many years since Mr. Godwin-Austen directed
    attention to what he considered evidence of ice-action during the coal
    period. This geologist found in the carboniferous strata of France
    large angular blocks which he could not account for without inferring
    the former action of ice. “Whether from local elevation,” he says,
    “or from climatic conditions, there are certain appearances over the
    whole which imply that at one time the temperature must have been very
    low, as glacier-action can alone account for the presence of the large
    angular blocks which occur in the lowest detrital beds of many of the
    southern coal-basins.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

  <p><em>Scotland.</em>—In Scotland great beds of conglomerate are met with in
    various parts, which are now considered by Professor Geikie, Mr.
    James Geikie, and other officers of the Geological Survey who have
    had opportunities of examining them, to be of glacial origin. “They
    are,” says Mr. James Geikie, “quite unstratified, and the stones often
    show that peculiar blunted form which is so characteristic of glacial
    work.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Many of the stones found by Professor Geikie, several of
    which I have had an opportunity of seeing, are well striated.</p>

  <p>In 1851 Professor Haughton brought forward at the Geological Society
    of Dublin, a case of angular fragments of granite occurring in the
    carboniferous limestone of the county of Dublin; and he explained the
    phenomena by the supposition of the transporting power of ice.</p>

  <p><em>North America.</em>—In one of the North American coal-fields Professor
    Newberry found a boulder of quartzite 17 inches by 12 inches, imbedded
    in a seam of coal. Similar facts have also been recorded both in the
    United States, and in Nova Scotia. Professor Dawson describes what he
    calls a gigantic esker of Carboniferous age, on the outside of which
    large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>travelled boulders were deposited, probably by drift-ice; while
    in the swamps within, the coal flora flourished.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

  <p><em>India.</em>—Mr. W. T. Blanford, of the Geological Survey of India, states
    that in beds considered to be of Carboniferous age are found large
    boulders, some of them as much as 15 feet in diameter. The bed in
    which these occur is a fine silt, and he refers the deposition of the
    boulders to ice-action. Within the last three years his views have
    received singular confirmation in another part of India, where beds
    of limestone were found striated below certain overlying strata. The
    probability that these appearances are due, as Mr. Blanford says, to
    the action of ice, is strengthened by the consideration that about five
    degrees farther to the north of the district in question rises the
    cold and high table-land of Thibet, which during a glacial epoch would
    undoubtedly be covered with ice that might well descend over the plains
    of India.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

  <p><em>Arctic Regions.</em>—A glacial epoch during the Carboniferous age may be
    indirectly inferred from the probable existence of warm inter-glacial
    periods, as indicated by the limestones with fossil remains found in
    arctic regions.</p>

  <p>That an equable condition of climate extended to near the north pole
    is proved by the fact that in the arctic regions vast masses of
    carboniferous limestone, having all the characters of the mountain
    limestone of England, have been found. “These limestones,” says
    Mr. Isbister, “are most extensively developed in the north-east
    extremity of the continent, where they occupy the greater part of
    the coast-line, from the north side of the Kotzebue Sound to within
    a few miles of Point Barrow, and form the chief constituent of the
    lofty and conspicuous headlands of Cape Thomson, Cape Lisburn, and
    Cape Sabine.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Limestone of the same age occurs extensively
    along the Mackenzie River. The following fossils have been found
    in these limestones:—<i>Terebratula resupinata</i>,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> <i>Lithostrotion
    basaltiforme</i>, <i>Cyathophyllum dianthum</i>, <i>C. flexuosum</i>, <i>Turbinolia
    mitrata</i>, <i>Productus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> Martini</i>,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> <i>Dentalium Sarcinula</i>,
    <i>Spiriferi</i>, <i>Orthidæ</i>, and encrinital fragments in the greatest
    abundance.</p>

  <p>Among the fossils brought home from Depôt Point, Albert Land, by
    Sir E. Belcher, Mr. Salter found the following, belonging to the
    Carboniferous period:—<i>Fusulina hyperborea</i>, <i>Stylastrea inconferta</i>,
    <i>Zaphrentis ovibos</i>, <i>Clisiophyllum tumulus</i>, <i>Syringopora (Aulopora)</i>,
    <i>Fenestella Arctica</i>, <i>Spirifera Keilhavii</i>, <i>Productus cora</i>, <i>P.
    semireticulatus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

  <p>Coal-beds of Carboniferous age are extensively developed in arctic
    regions. The fuel is of a highly bituminous character, resembling, says
    Professor Haughton, the gas coals of Scotland. The occurrence of coal
    in such high latitudes indicates beyond doubt that a mild and temperate
    condition of climate must, during some part of the Carboniferous age,
    have prevailed up to the very pole.</p>

  <p>“In the coal of Jameson’s Land, on the east side of Greenland, lying
    in latitude 71°, and in that of Melville Island, in latitude 75° N.,
    Professor Jameson found plants resembling fossils of the coal-fields of
    Britain.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

  <h3>PERMIAN PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>England.</em>—From the researches of Professor Ramsay in the Permian
    breccias, we have every reason to believe that during a part of the
    Permian age our country was probably covered with glaciers reaching
    to the sea. These brecciated stones, he states, are mostly angular
    or subangular, with flattened sides and but very slightly rounded at
    the edges, and are imbedded in a deep red marly paste. At Abberley
    Hill some of the masses are from 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and in one
    of the quarries, near the base of Woodbury Hill, Professor Ramsay
    saw one 2 feet in diameter. Another was observed at Woodbury Rock, 4
    feet long, 3 feet broad, and 1½ feet thick. The boulders were found
    in South Staffordshire, Enville, in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>Abberley and Malvern Hills,
    and other places. “They seem,” he says, “to have been derived from
    the conglomerate and green, grey, and purple Cambrian grits of the
    Longmynd, and from the Silurian quartz-rocks, slates, felstones,
    felspathic ashes, greenstones, and Upper Caradoc rocks of the country
    between the Longmynd and Chirbury. But then,” he continues, “the south
    end of the Malvern Hills is from forty to fifty miles, the Abberleys
    from twenty-five to thirty-five miles, Enville from twenty to thirty
    miles, and South Staffordshire from thirty-five to forty miles distant
    from that country.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

  <p>It is physically impossible, Professor Ramsay remarks, that these
    blocks could have been transported to such distances by any other
    agency than that of ice. Had they been transported by water, supposing
    such a thing possible, they would have been rounded and water-worn,
    whereas many of these stones are flat slabs, and most of them have
    their edges but little rounded. And besides many of them are highly
    polished, and others grooved and finely striated, exactly like those of
    the ancient glaciers of Scotland and Wales. Some of these specimens are
    to be seen in the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street.</p>

  <p><em>Scotland.</em>—In the Island of Arran, Mr. E. A. Wunsch and Mr. James
    Thomson found a bed of conglomerate which they considered of Permian
    age, and probably of glacial origin. This conglomerate enclosed angular
    fragments of various schistose, volcanic, and limestone rocks, and
    contained carboniferous fossils.</p>

  <p><em>Ireland.</em>—At Armagh, Ireland, Professor Hull found boulder beds of
    Permian age, containing pebbles and boulders, sometimes 2 feet in
    diameter. Some of the boulders must have been transported from a
    region lying about 30 miles to the north-west of the locality in which
    they now occur. It is difficult to conceive, says Professor Hull,
    how rock fragments of such a size could have been carried to their
    present position by any other agency than that of floating ice. This
    boulder-bed is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>overlaid by a recent bed of boulder clay. Professor
    Ramsay, who also examined the section, agrees with Professor Hull that
    the bed is of Permian age, and unquestionably of ice-formation.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

  <p>Professor Ramsay feels convinced that the same conclusions which he has
    drawn in regard to the Permian breccia of England will probably yet be
    found to hold good in regard to much of that of North Germany.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> And
    there appears to be some ground for concluding that the cold of that
    period even reached to India.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

  <p><em>South Africa.</em>—An ancient boulder clay, supposed to be either
    of Permian or Jurassic age, has been extensively found in Natal,
    South Africa. This deposit, discovered by Dr. Sutherland, the
    Surveyor-General of the colony, is thus described by Dr. Mann:—</p>

  <p>“The deposit itself consists of a greyish-blue argillaceous matrix,
    containing fragments of granite, gneiss, graphite, quartzite,
    greenstone, and clay-slate. These imbedded fragments are of various
    size, from the minute dimensions of sand-grains up to vast blocks
    measuring 6 feet across, and weighing from 5 to 10 tons. They are
    smoothed, as if they had been subject to a certain amount of attrition
    in a muddy sediment; but they are not rounded like boulders that
    have been subjected to sea-breakers. The fracture of the rock is not
    conchoidal, and there is manifest, in its substance, a rude disposition
    towards wavy stratification.”</p>

  <p>“Dr. Sutherland inclines to think that the transport of vast massive
    blocks of several tons’ weight, the scoring of the subjacent surfaces
    of sandstone, and the simultaneous deposition of minute sand-grains
    and large boulders in the same matrix, all point to one agency as the
    only one which can be rationally admitted to account satisfactorily
    for the presence of this remarkable formation in the situations in
    which it is found. He believes that the boulder-bearing clay of Natal
    is of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>analogous nature to the great Scandinavian drift, to which it
    is certainly intimately allied in intrinsic mineralogical character;
    that it is virtually a vast moraine of olden time; and that ice, in
    some form or other, has had to do with its formation, at least so far
    as the deposition of the imbedded fragments in the amorphous matrix are
    concerned.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

  <p>In the discussion which followed the reading of Dr. Sutherland’s paper,
    Professor Ramsay pointed out that in the Natal beds enormous blocks of
    rock occurred, which were 60 or 80 miles from their original home, and
    still remained angular; and there was a difficulty in accounting for
    the phenomena on any other hypothesis than that suggested.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stow, in his paper on the Karoo beds, has expressed a similar
    opinion regarding the glacial character of the formation.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

  <p>But we have in the Karoo beds evidence not only of glaciation, but of a
    much warmer condition of things than presently exists in that latitude.
    This is shown from the fact that the shells of the <i>Trigona</i>-beds
    indicate a tropical or subtropical condition of climate.</p>

  <p><em>Arctic Regions.</em>—The evidence which we have of the existence of a
    warm climate during the Permian period is equally conclusive. The
    close resemblance of the <i lang="la">flora</i> of the Permian period to that of
    Carboniferous times evidently points to the former prevalence of a warm
    and equable climate. And the existence of the magnesian limestone in
    high latitudes seems to indicate that during at least a part of the
    Permian period, just as during the accumulation of the carboniferous
    limestone, a warm sea must have obtained in those latitudes.</p>

  <h3>OOLITIC PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>North of Scotland.</em>—There is not wanting evidence of something like
    the action of ice during the Oolitic period.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

  <p>In the North of Scotland Mr. James Geikie says there is a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>coarse
    boulder conglomerate associated with the Jurassic strata in the east
    of Sutherland, the possibly glacial origin of which long ago suggested
    itself to Professor Ramsay and other observers. Mr. Judd believes the
    boulders to have been floated down by ice from the Highland mountains
    at the time the Jurassic strata were being accumulated.</p>

  <p><em>North Greenland.</em>—During the Oolitic period a warm condition of
    climate extended to North Greenland. For example, in Prince Patrick’s
    Island, at Wilkie Point, in lat. 76° 20′ N., and long. 117° 20′
    W., Oolitic rocks containing an ammonite (<i>Ammonites McClintocki</i>,
    Haughton), like <i>A. concavus</i> and other shells of Oolitic species,
    were found by Captain McClintock.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In Katmai Bay, near Behring’s
    Straits, the following Oolitic fossils were discovered—<i>Ammonites
    Wasnessenskii</i>, <i>A. biplex</i>, <i>Belemnites paxillosus</i>, and <i>Unio
    liassinus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Captain McClintock found at Point Wilkie, in Prince
    Patrick’s Island, lat. 76° 20′, a bone of <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>, and Sir E.
    Belcher found in Exmouth Island, lat. 76° 16′ N., and long. 96° W., at
    an elevation of 570 feet above the level of the sea, bones which were
    examined by Professor Owen, and pronounced to be those of the same
    animal.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Mr. Salter remarks that at the time that these fossils
    were deposited, “a condition of climate something like that of our own
    shores was prevailing in latitudes not far short of 80° N.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> And
    Mr. Jukes says that during the Oolitic period, “in latitudes where
    now sea and land are bound in ice and snow throughout the year, there
    formerly flourished animals and plants similar to those living in our
    own province at that time. The questions thus raised,” continues Mr.
    Jukes, “as to the climate of the globe when cephalopods and reptiles
    such as we should expect to find only in warm or temperate seas,
    could live in such high latitudes, are not easy to answer.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> And
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>Professor Haughton remarks, that he thinks it highly improbable that
    any change in the position of land and water could ever have produced a
    temperature in the sea at 76° north latitude which would allow of the
    existence of ammonites, especially species so like those that lived
    at the same time in the tropical warm seas of the South of England
    and France at the close of the Liassic, and commencement of the Lower
    Oolitic period.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

  <p>The great abundance of the limestone and coal of the Oolitic system
    shows also the warm and equable condition of the climate which must
    have then prevailed.</p>

  <h3>CRETACEOUS PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>Croydon.</em>—A large block of crystalline rock resembling granite was
    found imbedded in a pit, on the side of the old London and Brighton
    road near Purley, about two miles south of Croydon. Mr. Godwin-Austen
    has shown conclusively that it must have been transported there by
    means of floating ice. This boulder was associated with loose sea-sand,
    coarse shingle, and a smaller boulder weighing twenty or twenty-five
    pounds, and all water-worn. These had all sunk together without
    separating. Hence they must have been firmly held together, both during
    the time that they were being floated away, and also whilst sinking to
    the bottom of the cretaceous sea. Mr. Godwin-Austen supposes the whole
    to have been carried away frozen to the bottom of a mass of ground-ice.
    When the ice from melting became unable to float the mass attached to
    it, the whole would then sink to the bottom together.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

  <p><em>Dover.</em>—While the workmen were employed in cutting the tunnel on
    the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, between Lydden Hill and
    Shepherdswell, a few miles from Dover, they came upon a mass of coal
    imbedded in chalk, at a depth of 180 feet. It was about 4 feet square,
    and from 4 to 10 inches thick. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>The coal was friable and highly
    bituminous. It resembled some of the Wealden or Jurassic coal, and
    was unlike the true coal of the coal-measures. The specific gravity
    of the coal precluded the supposition that it could have floated away
    of itself into the cretaceous sea. “Considering its friability,” says
    Mr. Godwin-Austen, “I do not think that the agency of a floating tree
    could have been engaged in its transport; but, looking at its flat,
    angular form, it seems to me that its history may agree with what I
    have already suggested with reference to the boulder in the chalk
    at Croydon. We may suppose that during the Cretaceous period some
    bituminous beds of the preceding Oolitic period lay so as to be covered
    with water near the sea-margin, or along some river-bank, and from
    which portions could be carried off by ice, and so drifted away, until
    the ice was no longer able to support its load.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Godwin-Austen then mentions a number of other cases of blocks
    being found in the chalk. In regard to those cases he appropriately
    remarks that, as the cases where the occurrence of such blocks has
    been observed are likely to be far less numerous than those which have
    escaped observation, or failed to have been recorded, and as the chalk
    exposed in pits and quarries bears only a most trifling proportion to
    the whole horizontal extent of the formation, we have no grounds to
    conclude that the above are exceptional cases.</p>

  <p>Boulders have also been found in the cretaceous strata of the Alps by
    Escher von der Linth.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

  <p>The existence of warm periods during the Cretaceous age is plainly
    shown by the character of the flora and fauna of that age. The fact
    that chalk is of organic origin implies that the climate must have
    been warm and genial, and otherwise favourable to animal life. This is
    further manifested by such plants as <i>Cycas</i> and <i>Zamia</i>, which betoken
    a warm climate, and by the corals and huge sauroid reptiles which then
    inhabited our waters.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

  <p>It is, in fact, the tropical character of the fauna of that period
    which induced Sir Charles Lyell to reject Mr. Godwin-Austen’s idea that
    the boulders found in the chalk had been transported by floating ice.
    Such a supposition, implying a cold climate, “is,” Sir Charles says,
    “inconsistent with the luxuriant growth of large chambered univalves,
    numerous corals, and many fish, and other fossils of tropical forms.”</p>

  <p>The recent discovery of the Cretaceous formation in Greenland shows
    that during that period a mild and temperate condition of climate
    must have prevailed in that continent up to high latitudes. “This
    formation in Greenland,” says Dr. Robert Brown, “has only been recently
    separated from the Miocene formation, with which it is associated and
    was supposed to be a part of. It is, as far as we yet know, only found
    in the vicinity of Kome or Koke, near the shores of Omenak Fjord, in
    about 70° north latitude, though traces have been found elsewhere
    on Disco, &amp;c. The fossils hitherto brought to Europe have been very
    few, and consist of plants which are now preserved in the Stockholm
    and Copenhagen Museums. From these there seems little doubt that the
    age assigned to this limited deposit (so far as we yet know) by the
    celebrated palæontologist, Professor Oswald Heer, of Zurich, is the
    correct one.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Dr. Brown gives a list of the Cretaceous flora found
    in Greenland.</p>

  <h3>EOCENE PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>Switzerland.</em>—In a coarse conglomerate belonging to the “<i lang="de">flysch</i>”
    of Switzerland, an Eocene formation, there are found certain immense
    blocks, some of which consist of a variety of granite which is not
    known to occur <i lang="la">in situ</i> in any part of the Alps. Some of the blocks
    are 10 feet and upwards in length, and one at Halekeren, at the Lake of
    Thun, is 105 feet in length, 90 feet in breadth, and 45 feet in height.
    Similar blocks are found in the Apennines. These unmistakably <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>indicate
    the presence of glaciers or floating ice. This conclusion is further
    borne out by the fact that the “<i lang="de">flysch</i>” is destitute of organic
    remains. But the hypothesis that these huge masses were transported
    to their present sites by glaciers or floating ice has been always
    objected to, says Sir Charles Lyell, “on the ground that the Eocene
    strata of Nummulitic age in Switzerland, as well as in other parts of
    Europe, contain genera of fossil plants and animals characteristic of a
    warm climate. And it has been particularly remarked,” he continues, “by
    M. Desor that the strata most nearly associated with the ‘<i lang="de">flysch</i>’ in
    the Alps are rich in echinoderms of the <i>Spatangus</i> family which have a
    decided tropical aspect.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

  <p>But according to the theory of Secular Changes of Climate, the very
    fact that the “<i lang="de">flysch</i>” is immediately associated with beds indicating
    a warm or even tropical condition of climate, is one of the strongest
    proofs which could be adduced in favour of its glacial character, for
    the more severe a cold period of a glacial epoch is, the warmer will be
    the periods which immediately precede and succeed. These crocodiles,
    tortoises, and tropical flora probably belong to a warm Eocene
    inter-glacial period.</p>

  <h3>MIOCENE PERIOD.</h3>

  <p><em>Italy.</em>—We have strong evidence in favour of the opinion that a
    glacial epoch existed during the Miocene period. It has been shown
    by M. Gastaldi, that during that age Alpine glaciers extended to the
    sea-level.</p>

  <p>Near Turin there is a series of hills, rising about 500 or 600 feet
    above the valleys, composed of beds of Miocene sandstone, marl, and
    gravel, and loose conglomerate. These beds have been carefully examined
    and described by M. Gastaldi.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The hill of the Luperga has been
    particularly noticed by him. Many of the stones in these beds are
    striated in a manner similar to those found in the true till or boulder
    clay of this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>country. But what is most remarkable is the fact that
    large erratic blocks of limestone, many of them from 10 to 15 feet in
    diameter, are found in abundance in these beds. It has been shown by
    Gastaldi that these blocks have all been derived from the outer ridge
    of the Alps on the Italian side, namely, from the range extending from
    Ivrea to the Lago Maggiore, and consequently they must have travelled
    from twenty to eighty miles. So abundant are these large blocks, that
    extensive quarries have been opened in the hills for the sake of
    procuring them. These facts prove not only the existence of glaciers
    on the Alps during the Miocene period, but of glaciers extending to
    the sea and breaking up into icebergs; the stratification of the beds
    amongst which the blocks occur sufficiently indicating aqueous action
    and the former presence of the sea.</p>

  <p>That the glaciers of the Southern Alps actually reached to the sea,
    and sent their icebergs adrift over what are now the sunny plains of
    Northern Italy, is sufficient proof that during the cold period of
    Miocene times the climate must have been very severe. Indeed, it may
    well have been as severe as, if not even more excessive than, the
    intensest severity of climate experienced during the last great glacial
    epoch.</p>

  <p><em>Greenland.</em>—Of the existence of warm conditions during Miocene times,
    geology affords us abundant evidence. I shall quote the opinion of Sir
    Charles Lyell on this point:—</p>

  <p>“We know,” says Sir Charles, “that Greenland was not always covered
    with snow and ice; for when we examine the tertiary strata of Disco
    Island (of the Upper Miocene period), we discover there a multitude
    of fossil plants which demonstrate that, like many other parts of the
    arctic regions, it formerly enjoyed a mild and genial climate. Among
    the fossils brought from that island, lat. 70° N., Professor Heer has
    recognised <i>Sequoia Landsdorfii</i>, a coniferous species which flourished
    throughout a great part of Europe in the Miocene period. The same
    plant has been found fossil by Sir John Richardson within the Arctic
    Circle, far to the west on the Mackenzie River, near the entrance of
    Bear River; also by some Danish naturalists in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span> Iceland, to the east.
    The Icelandic surturband or lignite, of this age, has also yielded a
    rich harvest of plants, more than thirty-one of them, according to
    Steenstrup and Heer, in a good state of preservation, and no less than
    fifteen specifically identical with Miocene plants of Europe. Thirteen
    of the number are arborescent; and amongst others is a tulip-tree
    (<i>Liriodendron</i>), with its fruit and characteristic leaves, a plane
    (<i>Platanus</i>), a walnut, and a vine, affording unmistakable evidence
    of a climate in the parallel of the Arctic Circle which precludes the
    supposition of glaciers then existing in the neighbourhood, still less
    any general crust of continental ice like that of Greenland.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

  <p>At a meeting of the British Association, held at Nottingham in August
    1866, Professor Heer read a valuable paper on the “Miocene Flora of
    North Greenland.” In this paper some remarkable conclusions as to the
    probable temperature of Greenland during the Miocene period were given.</p>

  <p>Upwards of sixty different species brought from Atanekerdluk, a place
    on the Waigat opposite Disco, in lat. 70° N., have been examined by him.</p>

  <p>A steep hill rises on the coast to a height of 1,080 feet, and at
    this level the fossil plants are found. Large quantities of wood in
    a fossilized or carbonized condition lie about. Captain Inglefield
    observed one trunk thicker than a man’s body standing upright. The
    leaves, however, are the most important portion of the deposit. The
    rock in which they are found is a sparry iron ore, which turns reddish
    brown on exposure to the weather. In this rock the leaves are found, in
    places packed closely together, and many of them are in a very perfect
    condition. They give us a most valuable insight into the nature of the
    vegetation which formed this primeval forest.</p>

  <p>He arrives at the following conclusions:—</p>

  <p>1. <em>The fossilized plants of Atanekerdluk cannot have been drifted from
    any great distance. They must have grown on the spot where they were
    found.</em></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

  <p>This is shown—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) By the fact that Captain Inglefield and Dr. Ruik observed trunks
    of trees standing upright.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) By the great abundance of the leaves, and the perfect state of
    preservation in which they are found.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) By the fact that we find in the stone both fruits and seeds of
    the trees whose leaves are also found there.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) By the occurrence of insect remains along with the leaves.</p>

  <p>2. <em>The flora of Atanekerdluk is Miocene.</em></p>

  <p>3. <em>The flora is rich in species.</em></p>

  <p>4. <em>The flora proves without a doubt that North Greenland, in the
    Miocene epoch, had a climate much warmer than its present one. The
    difference must be at least</em> 29° F.</p>

  <p>Professor Heer discusses at considerable length this proposition. He
    says that the evidence from Greenland gives a final answer to those
    who objected to the conclusions as to the Miocene climate of Europe
    drawn by him on a former occasion. It is quite impossible that the
    trees found at Atanekerdluk could ever have flourished there if
    the temperature were not far higher than it is at present. This is
    clear from many of the species, of which we find the nearest living
    representative 10° or even 20° of latitude to the south of the locality
    in question.</p>

  <p>The trees of Atanekerdluk were not, he says, all at the extreme
    northern limit of their range, for in the Miocene flora of Spitzbergen,
    lat. 78° N., we find the beech, plane, hazelnut, and some other species
    identical with those from Greenland, and we may conclude, he thinks,
    that the firs and poplars which we meet at Atanekerdluk and Bell Sound,
    Spitzbergen, must have reached up to the North Pole if land existed
    there in the tertiary period.</p>

  <p>“The hills of fossilized wood,” he adds, “found by McClure and his
    companions in Banks’s Land (lat. 74° 27′ N.), are therefore discoveries
    which should not astonish us, they only confirm the evidence as to the
    original vegetation of the polar regions which we have derived from
    other sources.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Sequoia landsdorfii</i> is the most abundant of the trees of
    Atanekerdluk. The <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i> is its present representative.
    This tree has its extreme northern limit about lat. 53° N. For its
    existence it requires a summer temperature of 59° or 61° F. Its fruit
    requires a temperature of 64° for ripening. The winter temperature must
    not fall below 34°, and that of the whole year must be at least 49°.
    The temperature of Atanekerdluk during the time that the Miocene flora
    grew could not have been under the above.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

  <p>Professor Heer concludes his paper as follows:—</p>

  <p>“I think these facts are convincing, and the more so that they are not
    insulated, but confirmed by the evidence derivable from the Miocene
    flora of Iceland, Spitzbergen, and Northern Canada. These conclusions,
    too, are only links in the grand chain of evidence obtained from the
    examination of the Miocene flora of the whole of Europe. They prove to
    us that we could not by any re-arrangement of the relative positions
    of land and water produce for the northern hemisphere a climate which
    would explain the phenomena in a satisfactory manner. We must only
    admit that we are face to face with a problem, whose solution in all
    probability must be attempted, and, we doubt not, completed by the
    astronomer.”</p>

    commencement, but the length of its duration. M. Leverrier has not
    only determined the superior limit of the eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit, but has also given formulæ by means of which the extent of the
    eccentricity for any period, past or future, may be computed.</p>

  <p>A well-known astronomer and mathematician, who has specially
    investigated the subject, is of opinion that these formulæ give results
    which may be depended upon as approximately correct for <em>four millions
    of years</em> past and future. An eminent physicist has, however, expressed
    to me his doubts as to whether the results can be depended on for a
    period so enormous. M. Leverrier in his Memoir has given a table of the
    eccentricity for 100,000 years before and after 1800 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
    computed for intervals of 10,000 years. This table, no doubt, embraces
    a period sufficiently great for ordinary astronomical purposes, but it
    is by far too limited to afford information in regard to geological
    epochs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

  <p>With the view of ascertaining the probable date of the glacial epoch,
    as well as the character of the climate for a long course of ages,
    <a href="#TABLE_I">Table I.</a> was computed from M. Leverrier’s formulæ.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> It shows the
    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit and longitude of the perihelion for
    3,000,000 of years back, and 1,000,000 of years to come, at periods
    50,000 years apart.</p>

  <p>On looking over the table it will be seen that there are three
    principal periods when the eccentricity rose to a very high value,
    with a few subordinate maxima between. It will be perceived also that
    during each of those periods the eccentricity does not remain at the
    same uniform value, but rises and falls, in one case twice, and in the
    other two cases three times. About 2,650,000 years back we have the
    eccentricity almost at its inferior limit. It then begins to increase,
    and fifty thousand years afterwards, namely at 2,600,000 years ago, it
    reaches ·0660; fifty thousand years after this period it has diminished
    to ·0167, which is about its present value. It then begins to increase,
    and in another fifty thousand years, namely at 2,500,000 years ago, it
    approaches to almost the superior limit, its value being then ·0721. It
    then begins to diminish, and at 2,450,000 years ago it has diminished
    to ·0252. These two maxima, separated by a minimum and extending over a
    period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
    of 200,000 years, constitute the first great period of high
    eccentricity. We then pass onwards for upwards of a million and a half
    years, and we come to the second great period. It consists of three
    maxima separated by two minima. The first maximum occurred at 950,000
    years ago, the second or middle one at 850,000 years ago, and the
    third and last at 750,000 years ago—the whole extending over a period
    of nearly 300,000 years. Passing onwards for another million and half
    years, or to about 800,000 years in the future, we come to the third
    great period. It also consists of three maxima one hundred thousand
    years apart. Those occur at the periods 800,000, 900,000, and 1,000,000
    years to come, respectively, separated also by two minima. Those three
    great periods, two of them in the past and one of them in the future,
    included in the Table, are therefore separated from each other by an
    interval of upwards of 1,700,000 years.</p>

  <p>In this Table there are seven periods when the earth’s orbit becomes
    nearly circular, four in the past and three in the future.</p>

  <p>The Table shows also four or five subordinate periods of high
    eccentricity, the principal one occurring 200,000 years ago.</p>

  <p>The variations of eccentricity during the four millions of years, are
    represented to the eye diagrammatically in <a href="#PLATE_IV">Plate IV.</a></p>

  <p>In order to determine with more accuracy the condition of the earth’s
    orbit during the three periods of great eccentricity included in Table
    I., I computed the values for periods of ten thousand years apart, and
    the results are embodied in Tables II., III., and IV.</p>

  <p>There are still eminent astronomers and physicists who are of opinion
    that the climate of the globe never could have been seriously affected
    by changes in the eccentricity of its orbit. This opinion results, no
    doubt, from viewing the question as a purely astronomical one. Viewed
    from an astronomical standpoint, as has been already remarked, there
    is actually nothing from which any one could reasonably conclude with
    certainty whether a change of eccentricity would seriously affect
    climate or not. By means of astronomy we ascertain the extent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
    eccentricity at any given period, how much the winter may exceed
    the summer in length (or the reverse), how much the sun’s heat is
    increased or decreased by a decrease or an increase of distance,
    and so forth; but we obtain no information whatever regarding how
    these will actually affect climate. This, as we have already seen,
    must be determined wholly from physical considerations, and it is
    an exceedingly complicated problem. An astronomer, unless he has
    given special attention to the physics of the question, is just as
    apt to come to a wrong conclusion as any one else. The question
    involves certain astronomical elements; but when these are determined
    everything then connected with the matter is purely physical. Nearly
    all the astronomical elements of the question are comprehended in the
    accompanying Tables.</p>

  <p>In Tables II., III., and IV., column I. represents the dates of the
    periods, column II. the eccentricity, column III. the longitude of
    the perihelion. In Table IV. the eccentricity and the longitude of
    the perihelion of the six periods marked with an S are copied from a
    letter of Mr. Stone to Sir Charles Lyell, published in the Supplement
    of the Phil. Mag. for June, 1865; the eight periods marked L are copied
    from M. Leverrier’s Table, to which reference has been made. For the
    correctness of everything else, both in this Table and in the other
    three, I alone am responsible.</p>

  <p>Column IV. gives the number of degrees passed over by the perihelion
    during each 10,000 years. From this column it will be seen how
    irregular is the motion of the perihelion. At four different periods
    it had a retrograde motion for 20,000 years. Column V. shows the
    number of days by which the winter exceeds the summer when the winter
    occurs in aphelion. Column VI. shows the intensity of the sun’s heat
    during midwinter, when the winter occurs in aphelion, the present
    midwinter intensity being taken at 1,000. These six columns comprehend
    all the astronomical part of the Tables. Regarding the correctness of
    the principles upon which these columns are constructed, there is no
    diversity of opinion. But these columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> afford no direct information
    as to the character of the climate, or how much the temperature is
    increased or diminished. To find this we pass on to columns VII. and
    VIII., calculated on physical principles. Now, unless the physical
    principles upon which these three columns are calculated be wholly
    erroneous, change of eccentricity must undoubtedly very seriously
    affect climate. Column VII. shows how many degrees Fahrenheit the
    temperature is lowered by a decrease in the intensity of the sun’s heat
    corresponding to column VI. For example, 850,000 years ago, if the
    winters occurred then in aphelion, the direct heat of the sun during
    midwinter would be only 837/1000 of what it is at present at the same
    season of the year, and column VII. shows that this decrease in the
    intensity of the sun’s heat would lower the temperature 45°·3 F.</p>

  <p>The principle upon which this result is arrived at is this:&mdash;The
    temperature of space, as determined by Sir John Herschel, is −239°
    F. M. Pouillet, by a different method, arrived at almost the same
    result. If we take the midwinter temperature of Great Britain at
    39°, then 239° + 39° = 278° will represent the number of degrees of
    rise due to the sun’s heat at midwinter; in other words, it takes a
    quantity of sun-heat which we have represented by 1000 to maintain the
    temperature of the earth’s surface in Great Britain 278° above the
    temperature of space. Were the sun extinguished, the temperature of
    our island would sink 278° below its present midwinter temperature,
    or to the temperature of space. But 850,000 years ago, as will be
    seen from <a href="#TABLE_III">Table III.</a>, if the winters occurred in aphelion, the heat
    of the sun at midwinter would only equal 837 instead of 1000 as at
    present. Consequently, if it takes 1,000 parts of heat to maintain the
    temperature 278° above the temperature of space, 837 parts of heat will
    only be able to maintain the temperature 232°·7 above the temperature
    of space; for 232°·7 is to 278 as 837 is to 1,000. Therefore, if the
    temperature was then only 232°·7 above that of space, it would be
    45°·3 below what it is at present. This is what the temperature would
    be on the supposition, of course, that it depended wholly on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
    sun’s intensity and was not modified by other causes. This method has
    already been discussed at some length in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> But whether these
    values be too high or too low, one thing is certain, that a very slight
    increase or a very slight decrease in the quantity of heat received
    from the sun must affect temperature to a considerable extent. The
    direct heat of the moon, for example, cannot be detected by the finest
    instruments which we possess; yet from 238,000 observations made at
    Prague during 1840−66, it would seem that the temperature is sensibly
    affected by the mere change in the lunar perigee and inclination of the
    moon’s orbit.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

  <p>Column VIII. gives the midwinter temperature. It is found by
    subtracting the numbers in column VII. from 39°, the present midwinter
    temperature.</p>

  <p>I have not given a Table showing the temperature of the summers at
    the corresponding periods. This could not well be done; for there is
    no relation at the periods in question between the intensity of the
    sun’s heat and the temperature of the summers. One is apt to suppose,
    without due consideration, that the summers ought to be then as much
    warmer than they are at present, as the winters were then colder than
    now. Sir Charles Lyell, in his “Principles,” has given a column of
    summer temperatures calculated from my table upon this principle.
    Astronomically the principle is correct, but physically, as was shown
    in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>, it is totally erroneous, and calculated to convey a
    wrong impression regarding the whole subject of geological climate.
    The summers at those periods, instead of being much warmer than they
    are at present, would in reality be much colder, notwithstanding the
    great increase in the intensity of the sun’s heat resulting from the
    diminished distance of the sun.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the date of the glacial epoch? It is perfectly obvious
    that if the glacial epoch resulted from a high state of eccentricity,
    it must be referred either to the period included <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>in <a href="#TABLE_III">Table III.</a> or
    to the one in <a href="#TABLE_IV">Table IV.</a> In <a href="#TABLE_III">Table III.</a> we have a period extending from
    about 980,000 to about 720,000 years ago, and in <a href="#TABLE_IV">Table IV.</a> we have a
    period beginning about 240,000 years ago, and extending down to about
    80,000 years ago. As the former period was of greater duration than
    the latter, and the eccentricity also attained to a higher value, I at
    first felt disposed to refer the glacial epoch proper (the time of the
    till and boulder clay) to the former period; and the latter period, I
    was inclined to believe, must have corresponded to the time of local
    glaciers towards the close of the glacial epoch, the evidence for which
    (moraines) is to be found in almost every one of our Highland glens.
    On this point I consulted several eminent geologists, and they all
    agreed in referring the glacial epoch to the former period; the reason
    assigned being that they considered the latter period to be much too
    recent and of too short duration to represent that epoch.</p>

  <p>Pondering over the subject during the early part of 1866, reasons soon
    suggested themselves which convinced me that the glacial epoch must
    be referred to the latter and not to the former period. Those reasons
    I shall now proceed to state at some length, since they have a direct
    bearing, as will be seen, on the whole question of geological time.</p>

  <p>It is the modern and philosophic doctrine of uniformity that has
    chiefly led geologists to over-estimate the length of geological
    periods. This philosophic school teaches, and that truly, that the
    great changes undergone by the earth’s crust must have been produced,
    not by convulsions and cataclysms of nature, but by those ordinary
    agencies that we see at work every day around us, such as rain, snow,
    frost, ice, and chemical action, &amp;c. It teaches that the valleys
    were not produced by violent dislocations, nor the hills by sudden
    upheavals, but that they were actually carved out of the solid rock
    by the silent and gentle agency of chemical action, frost, rain, ice,
    and running water. It teaches, in short, that the rocky face of our
    globe has been carved into hill and dale, and ultimately worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span> down
    to the sea-level, by means of these apparently trifling agents, not
    only once or twice, but probably dozens of times over during past
    ages. Now, when we reflect that with such extreme slowness do these
    agents perform their work, that we might watch their operations from
    year to year, and from century to century, if we could, without being
    able to perceive that they make any very sensible advance, we are
    necessitated to conclude that geological periods must be enormous. And
    the conclusion at which we thus arrive is undoubtedly correct. It is,
    in fact, impossible to form an adequate conception of the length of
    geological time. It is something too vast to be fully grasped by our
    minds. But here we come to the point where the fundamental mistake
    arises; Geologists do not err in forming too great a conception of the
    extent of geological periods, <em>but in the mode in which they represent
    the length of these periods in numbers</em>. When we speak of units, tens,
    hundreds, thousands, we can form some notion of what these quantities
    represent; but when we come to millions, tens of millions, hundreds
    of millions, thousands of millions, the mind is then totally unable
    to follow, and we can only use these numbers as representations of
    quantities that turn up in calculation. We know, from the way in which
    they do turn up in our process of calculation, whether they are correct
    representations of things in actual nature or not; but we could not,
    from a mere comparison of these quantities with the thing represented
    by them, say whether they were actually too small or too great.</p>

  <p>At present, geological estimates of time are little else than mere
    conjectures. Geological science has hitherto afforded no trustworthy
    means of estimating the positive length of geological epochs.
    Geological phenomena tell us most emphatically that these periods
    must be long; but how long they have hitherto failed to inform us.
    Geological phenomena represent time to the mind under a most striking
    and imposing form. They present to the eye, as it were, a sensuous
    representation of time; the mind thus becomes deeply impressed with
    a sense of immense duration; and when one under these feelings is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
    called upon to put down in figures what he believes will represent that
    duration, he is very apt to be deceived. If, for example, a million of
    years as represented by geological phenomena and a million of years as
    represented by figures were placed before our eyes, we should certainly
    feel startled. We should probably feel that a unit with six ciphers
    after it was really something far more formidable than we had hitherto
    supposed it to be. Could we stand upon the edge of a gorge a mile and
    a half in depth that had been cut out of the solid rock by a tiny
    stream, scarcely visible at the bottom of this fearful abyss, and were
    we informed that this little streamlet was able to wear off annually
    only 1/10 of an inch from its rocky bed, what would our conceptions be
    of the prodigious length of time that this stream must have taken to
    excavate the gorge? We should certainly feel startled when, on making
    the necessary calculations, we found that the stream had performed this
    enormous amount of work in something less than a million of years.</p>

  <p>If, for example, we could possibly form some adequate conception of a
    period so prodigious as one hundred millions of years, we should not
    then feel so dissatisfied with Sir W. Thomson’s estimate that the age
    of the earth’s crust is not greater than that.</p>

  <p>Here is one way of conveying to the mind some idea of what a million
    of years really is. Take a narrow strip of paper an inch broad, or
    more, and 83 feet 4 inches in length, and stretch it along the wall of
    a large hall, or round the walls of an apartment somewhat over 20 feet
    square. Recall to memory the days of your boyhood, so as to get some
    adequate conception of what a period of a hundred years is. Then mark
    off from one of the ends of the strip 1/10 of an inch. The 1/10 of the
    inch will then represent one hundred years, and the entire length of
    the strip a million of years. It is well worth making the experiment,
    just in order to feel the striking impression that it produces on the
    mind.</p>

  <p>The latter period, which we have concluded to be that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> glacial
    epoch, extended, as we have seen, over a period of 160,000 years. But
    as the glaciation was only on one hemisphere at a time, 80,000 years
    or so would represent the united length of the cold periods. In order
    to satisfy ourselves that this period is sufficiently long to account
    for all the amount of denudation effected during the glacial epoch,
    let us make some rough estimate of the probable rate at which the
    surface of the country would be ground down by the ice. Suppose the
    ice to grind off only one-tenth of an inch annually this would give
    upwards of 650 feet as the quantity of rock removed during the time.
    But it is probable that it did not amount to one-fourth part of that
    quantity. Whether one-tenth of an inch per annum be an over-estimate or
    an under-estimate of the rate of denudation by the ice, it is perfectly
    evident that the period in question is sufficiently long, so far as
    denudation is concerned, to account for the phenomena of the glacial
    epoch.</p>

  <p>But admitting that the period under consideration is sufficiently
    <em>long</em> to account for all the denudation which took place <em>during</em>
    the glacial epoch, we have yet to satisfy ourselves that it is also
    sufficiently <em>remote</em> to account for all the denudation which has taken
    place <em>since</em> the glacial epoch. Are the facts of geology consistent
    with the idea that the close of the glacial epoch does not date back
    beyond 80,000 years?</p>

  <p>This question could be answered if we knew the present rate of
    subaërial denudation, for the present rate evidently does not differ
    greatly from that which has obtained since the close of the glacial
    epoch.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is almost self-evident that the rate of subaërial denudation must
    be equal to the rate at which the materials are carried off the land
    into the sea, but the rate at which the materials are carried off the
    land is measured by the rate at which sediment is carried down by our
    river systems. <em>Consequently, in order to determine the present rate
    of subaërial denudation, we have only to ascertain the quantity of
    sediment annually carried down by the river systems.</em></p>

  <p>Knowing the quantity of sediment transported by a river, say annually,
    and the area of its drainage, we have the means of determining the
    rate at which the surface of this area is being lowered by subaërial
    denudation. And if we know this in reference to a few of the great
    continental rivers draining immense areas in various latitudes, we
    could then ascertain with tolerable correctness the rate at which the
    surface of the globe is being lowered by subaërial denudation, and
    also the length of time which our present continents can remain above
    the sea-level. Explaining this to Professor Ramsay during the winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
    of 1865, I learned from him that accurate measurements had been made
    of the amount of sediment annually carried down by the Mississippi
    River, full particulars of which investigations were to be found
    in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement
    of Science for 1848. These proceedings contain a report by Messrs.
    Brown and Dickeson, which unfortunately over-estimated the amount of
    sediment transported by the Mississippi by nearly four times what
    was afterwards found by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot to be the actual
    amount. From this estimate, I was led to the conclusion that if the
    Mississippi is a fair representative of rivers in general, our existing
    continents would not remain longer than one million and a half years
    above the sea-level.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> This was a conclusion so startling as to
    excite suspicion that there must have been some mistake in reference
    to Messrs. Brown and Dickeson’s data. It showed beyond doubt, however,
    that the rate of subaërial denudation, when accurately determined by
    this method, would be found to be enormously greater than had been
    supposed. Shortly afterwards, on estimating the rate from the data
    furnished by Humphreys and Abbot, I found the rate of denudation to
    be about one foot in 6,000 years. Taking the mean elevation of all
    the land as ascertained by Humboldt to be 1,000 feet, the whole would
    therefore be carried down into the ocean by our river systems in about
    6,000,000 of years if no elevation of the land took place.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The
    following are the data and mode of computation by which this conclusion
    was arrived at. It was found by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot that the
    average amount of sediment held in suspension in the waters of the
    Mississippi is about 1/1500 of the weight of the water, or 1/2900
    by bulk. The annual discharge of the river is 19,500,000,000,000
    cubic feet of water. The quantity of sediment carried down into the
    Gulf of Mexico amounts to 6,724,000,000 cubic feet. But besides
    that which is held in suspension, the river pushes down into the
    sea about 750,000,000 cubic feet of earthy matter, making in all a
    total of 7,474,000,000 cubic feet <span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>transferred from the land to the
    sea annually. Where does this enormous mass of material come from?
    Unquestionably it comes from the ground drained by the Mississippi. The
    area drained by the river is 1,244,000 square miles. Now 7,474,000,000
    cubic feet removed off 1,224,000 square miles of surface is equal to
    1/4566 of a foot off that surface per annum, or one foot in 4,566
    years. The specific gravity of the sediment is taken at 1·9, that of
    rock is about 2·5; consequently the amount removed is equal to one foot
    of rock in about 6,000 years. The average height of the North American
    continent above the sea-level, according to Humboldt, is 748 feet;
    consequently, at the present rate of denudation, the whole area of
    drainage will be brought down to the sea-level in less than 4,500,000
    years, if no elevation of the land takes place.</p>

  <p>Referring to the above, Sir Charles Lyell makes the following
    appropriate remarks:—“There seems no danger of our overrating the
    mean rate of waste by selecting the Mississippi as our example, for
    that river drains a country equal to more than half the continent of
    Europe, extends through twenty degrees of latitude, and therefore
    through regions enjoying a great variety of climate, and some of its
    tributaries descend from mountains of great height. The Mississippi
    is also more likely to afford us a fair test of ordinary denudation,
    because, unlike the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, there are no
    great lakes in which the fluviatile sediment is thrown down and
    arrested on its way to the sea.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

  <p>The rate of denudation of the area drained by the river Ganges is much
    greater than that of the Mississippi. The annual discharge of that
    river is 6,523,000,000,000 cubic feet of water. The sediment held in
    suspension is equal to 1/510 by weight; area of drainage 432,480 square
    miles. This gives one foot of rock in 2,358 years as the amount removed.</p>

  <p>Rough estimates have been made of the amount of sediment carried down
    by some eight or ten European rivers; and although those estimates
    cannot be depended upon as being <span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>anything like perfectly accurate,
    still they show (what there is very little reason to doubt) that it is
    extremely probable that the European continent is being denuded about
    as rapidly as the American.</p>

  <p>For a full account of all that is known on this subject I must
    refer to Professor Geikie’s valuable memoir on Modern Denudation
    (Transactions of Geological Society of Glasgow, vol. iii.; also Jukes
    and Geikie’s “Manual of Geology,” chap. xxv.) It is mainly through the
    instrumentality of this luminous and exhaustive memoir that the method
    under consideration has gained such wide acceptance amongst geologists.</p>

  <p>Professor Geikie finds that at the present rate of erosion the
    following is the number of years required by the undermentioned rivers
    to remove one foot of rock from the general surface of their basins.
    Professor Geikie thus shows that the rate of denudation, as determined
    from the amount of sediment carried down the Mississippi, is certainly
    not too high.</p>

  <p>By means of subaërial agencies continents are being cut up into
    islands, the islands into smaller islands, and so on till the whole
    ultimately disappears.</p>

  <p>No proper estimate has been made of the quantity of sediment carried
    down into the sea by our British rivers. But, from the principles just
    stated, we may infer that it must be as great in proportion to the area
    of drainage as that carried down by the Mississippi. For example, the
    river Tay, which drains a great portion of the central Highlands of
    Scotland, carries to the sea three times as much water in proportion
    to its area of drainage as is carried by the Mississippi. And any one
    who has seen this rapidly running river during a flood, red and turbid
    with sediment, will easily be convinced that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span> quantity of solid
    material carried down by it into the German Ocean must be very great.
    Mr. John Dougall has found that the waters of the Clyde during a flood
    hold in suspension 1/800 by bulk of sediment. The observations were
    made about a mile above the city of Glasgow. But even supposing the
    amount of sediment held in suspension by the waters of the Tay to be
    only one-third (which is certainly an under-estimate) of that of the
    Mississippi, viz. 1/4500 by weight, still this would give the rate of
    denudation of the central Highlands at one foot in 6,000 years, or
    1,000 feet in 6 millions of years.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that although so many measurements have been made of
    the amount of fluviatile sediment being transported seawards, yet that
    the bearing which this has on the broad questions of geological time
    and the rate of subaërial denudation should have been overlooked. One
    reason for this, no doubt, is that the measurements were made, not
    with a view to determine the rate at which the river basins are being
    lowered, but mainly to ascertain the age of the river deltas and the
    rate at which these are being formed.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

  <p><em>The Law which determines the Rate at which any Country is being
    denuded.</em>—By means of subaërial agencies continents are being cut up
    into islands, the islands into smaller islands, and so on till the
    whole ultimately disappears.</p>

  <p>So long as the present order of things remains, the rate of denudation
    will continue while land remains above the sea-level; and we have no
    warrant for supposing that the rate was during past ages less than it
    is at the present day. It will not do to object that, as a considerable
    amount of the sediment carried down by rivers is boulder clay and
    other materials belonging to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>the Ice age, the total amount removed
    by the rivers is on that account greater than it would otherwise be.
    Were this objection true, it would follow that, prior to the glacial
    period, when it is assumed that there was no boulder clay, the face of
    the country must have consisted of bare rock; for in this case no soil
    could have accumulated from the disintegration and decomposition of the
    rocks, <em>since, unless the rocks of a country disintegrate more rapidly
    than the river systems are able to carry the disintegrated materials
    to the sea, no surface soil can form on that country</em>. The rate at
    which rivers carry down sediment is evidently not determined by the
    rate at which the rocks are disintegrated and decomposed, but by the
    quantity of rain falling, and the velocity with which it moves off the
    face of the country. Every river system possesses a definite amount of
    carrying-power, depending upon the slope of the ground, the quantity of
    rain falling per annum, the manner in which the rain falls, whether it
    falls gradually or in torrents, and a few other circumstances. When it
    so happens, as it generally does, that the amount of rock disintegrated
    on the face of the country is greater than the carrying-power of the
    river systems can remove, then a soil necessarily forms. But when the
    reverse is the case no soil can form on that country, and it will
    present nothing but barren rock. This is no doubt the reason why in
    places like the Island of Skye, for example, where the rocks are
    exceedingly hard and difficult to decompose and separate, the ground
    steep, and the quantity of rain falling very great, there is so much
    bare rock to be seen. If, prior to the glacial epoch, the rocks of
    the area drained by the Mississippi did not produce annually more
    material from their destruction under atmospheric agency than was being
    carried down by that river, then it follows that the country must have
    presented nothing but bare rock, if the amount of rain falling then was
    as great as at present.</p>

  <p>But, after all, one foot removed off the general level of the country
    since the creation of man, according to Mosaic chronology, is certainly
    not a very great quantity. No person but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span> one who had some preconceived
    opinions to maintain, would ever think of concluding that one foot of
    soil during 6,000 years was an extravagant quantity to be washed off
    the face of the country by rain and floods during that long period.
    Those who reside in the country and are eye-witnesses of the actual
    effects of heavy rains upon the soil, our soft country roads, ditches,
    brooks, and rivers, will have considerable difficulty in actually
    believing that only one foot has been washed away during the past 6,000
    years.</p>

  <p>Some may probably admit that a foot of soil may be washed off during
    a period so long as 6,000 years, and may tell us that what they deny
    is not that a foot of loose and soft soil, but a foot of solid rock
    can be washed away during that period. But a moment’s reflection must
    convince them that, unless the rocks of the country were disintegrating
    and decomposing as rapidly into soil as the rain is carrying the soil
    away, the surface of the country would ultimately become bare rock. It
    is true that the surface of our country in many places is protected by
    a thick covering of boulder clay; but when this has once been removed,
    the rocks will then disintegrate far more rapidly than they are doing
    at present.</p>

  <p>But slow as is the rate at which the country is being denuded, yet
    when we take into consideration a period so enormous as 6 millions of
    years, we find that the results of denudation are really startling.
    One thousand feet of solid rock during that period would be removed
    from off the face of the country. But if the mean level of the country
    would be lowered 1,000 feet in 6 millions of years, how much would our
    valleys and glens be deepened during that period? This is a problem
    well worthy of the consideration of those who treat with ridicule the
    idea that the general features of our country have been carved out by
    subaërial agency.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the retardation of the earth’s rotation, occasioned
    by the friction of the tidal wave, the sea-level must be slowly sinking
    at the equator and rising at the poles. But it is probable that the
    land at the equator is being lowered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> denudation as rapidly as
    the sea-level is sinking. <em>Nearly one mile must have been worn off
    the equator during the past 12 millions of years</em>, if the rate of
    denudation all along the equator be equal to that of the basin of the
    Ganges. It therefore follows that we cannot infer from the present
    shape of our globe what was its form, or the rate at which it was
    rotating, at the time when its crust became solidified. Although it
    had been as oblate as the planet Jupiter, denudation must in time have
    given it its present form.</p>

  <p>There is another effect which would result from the denudation of the
    equator and the sinking of the ocean at the equator and its rise at
    the poles. This, namely, that it would tend to increase the rate of
    rotation; or, more properly, it would tend to <em>lessen</em> the rate of
    tidal retardation.</p>

  <p>But if the rate of denudation be at present so great, what must it
    have been during the glacial epoch? It must have been something
    enormous. At present, denudation is greatly retarded by the limited
    power of our river systems to remove the loose materials resulting
    from the destruction of the rocks. These materials accumulate and form
    a thick soil over the surface of the rocks, which protects them, to a
    great extent, from the weathering effects of atmospheric agents. So
    long as the amount of rock disintegrated exceeds that which is being
    removed by the river systems, the soil will continue to accumulate
    till the amount of rock destroyed per annum is brought to equal that
    which is being removed. It therefore follows from this principle that
    the <span class="smcap">carrying-power of our river systems is the true measure of
    denudation</span>. But during the glacial epoch the thickness of the soil
    would have but little effect in diminishing the waste of the rocks; for
    at that period the rocks were not decomposed by atmospheric agency,
    but were ground down by the mechanical friction of the ice. But the
    presence of a thick soil at this period, instead of retarding the rate
    of denudation, would tend to increase it tenfold, for the soil would
    then be used as grinding-material for the ice-sheet. In places where
    the ice was, say, 2,000 feet in thickness, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span> soil would be forced
    along over the rocky face of the country, exerting a pressure on the
    rocks equal to 50 tons on the square foot.</p>

  <p>It is true that the rate at which many kinds of rocks decompose and
    disintegrate is far less than what has been concluded to be the mean
    rate of denudation of the whole country. This is evident from the fact
    which has been adduced by some writers, that inscriptions on stones
    which have been exposed to atmospheric agency for a period of 2,000
    years or so, have not been obliterated. But in most cases epitaphs on
    monuments and tombstones, and inscriptions on the walls of buildings,
    200 years old, can hardly be read. And this is not all: the stone on
    which the letters were cut has during that time rotted in probably to
    the depth of several inches; and during the course of a few centuries
    more the whole mass will crumble into dust.</p>

  <p>The facts which we have been considering show also how trifling is the
    amount of denudation effected by the sea in comparison with that by
    subaërial agents. The entire sea-coast of the globe, according to Dr.
    A. Keith Johnston, is 116,531 miles. Suppose we take the average height
    of the coast-line at 25 feet, and take also the rate at which the sea
    is advancing on the land at one foot in 100 years, then this gives
    15,382,500,000 cubic feet of rock as the total amount removed in 100
    years by the action of the sea. The total amount of land is 57,600,000
    square miles, or 1,605,750,000,000,000 square feet; and if one foot is
    removed off the surface in 6,000 years, then 26,763,000,000,000 cubic
    feet is removed by subaërial agency in 100 years, or about 1,740 times
    as much as that removed by the sea. Before the sea could denude the
    globe as rapidly as the subaërial agents, it would have to advance on
    the land at the rate of upwards of 17 feet annually.</p>

  <p>It will not do, however, to measure marine denudation by the rate at
    which the sea is advancing on the land. There is no relation whatever
    between the rate at which the sea is <em>advancing</em> on the land and the
    rate at which the sea is <em>denuding</em> the land. For it is evident that as
    the subaërial agents bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span> the coast down to the sea-level, all that
    the sea has got to do is simply to advance, or at most to remove the
    loose materials which may lie in its path. The amount of denudation
    which has been effected by the sea during past geological ages,
    compared with what has been effected by subaërial agency, is evidently
    but trifling. Denudation is not the proper function of the sea. The
    great denuding agents are land-ice, frost, rain, running-water,
    chemical agency, &amp;c. The proper work which belongs to the sea is the
    transporting of the loose materials carried down by the rivers, and the
    spreading of these out so as to form the stratified beds of future ages.</p>

  <p><em>Previous Methods of measuring Geological Time unreliable.</em>—The method
    which has just been detailed of estimating the rate of subaërial
    denudation seems to afford the only reliable means of a geological
    character of determining geological time in absolute measure. The
    methods which have hitherto been adopted not only fail to give the
    positive length of geological periods, but some of them are actually
    calculated to mislead.</p>

  <p>The common method of calculating the length of a period from the
    thickness of the stratified rocks belonging to that period is one of
    that class. Nothing whatever can be inferred from the thickness of a
    deposit as to the length of time which was required to form it. The
    thickness of a deposit will depend upon a great many circumstances,
    such as whether the deposition took place near to land or far away in
    the deep recesses of the ocean, whether it occurred at the mouth of a
    great river or along the sea-shore, or at a time when the sea-bottom
    was rising, subsiding, or remaining stationary. Stratified formations
    10,000 feet in thickness, for example, may, under some conditions, have
    been formed in as many years, while under other conditions it may have
    required as many centuries. Nothing whatever can be safely inferred as
    to the absolute length of a period from the thickness of the stratified
    formations belonging to that period. Neither will this method give us a
    trustworthy estimate of the <em>relative</em> lengths of geological periods.
    Suppose we find the average thickness of the Cambrian rocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> to be,
    say, 26,000 feet, the Silurian to be 28,000 feet, the Devonian to be
    6,000 feet, and the Tertiary to be 10,000 feet, it would not be safe
    to assume, as is sometimes done, that the relative duration of those
    periods must have corresponded to these numbers. Were we sure that we
    had got the correct average thickness of all the rocks belonging to
    each of those formations, we might probably be able to arrive at the
    relative lengths of those periods; but we can never be sure of this.
    Those formations all, at one time, formed sea-bottoms; and we can only
    measure such deposits as are now raised above the sea-level. But is
    not it probable that the relative positions of sea and land during the
    Cambrian, Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous, and other early
    periods of the earth’s history, differed more from the present than the
    distribution of sea and land during the Tertiary period differed from
    that which obtains now? May not the greater portion of the Tertiary
    deposits be still under the sea-bottom? And if this be the case, it may
    yet be found at some day in the distant future, when these deposits
    are elevated into dry land, that they are much thicker than we now
    conclude them to be. Of course, it is by no means asserted that this
    is so, but only that they <em>may</em> be thicker for anything we know to the
    contrary; and the possibility that they may, destroys our confidence
    in the accuracy of this method of determining the relative lengths of
    geological periods.</p>

  <p>Neither does palæontology afford any better mode of measuring
    geological time. In fact, the palæontological method of estimating
    geological time, either absolute or relative, from the rate at which
    species change, appears to be even still more unsatisfactory. If we
    could ascertain by some means or other the time that has elapsed from
    some given epoch (say, for example, the glacial) till the present
    day, and were we sure at the same time that species have changed at a
    uniform rate during all past ages, then, by ascertaining the percentage
    of change that has taken place since the glacial epoch, we should
    have a means of making something like a rough estimate of the length
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span> various periods. But without some such period to start with,
    the palæontological method is useless. It will not do to take the
    historic period as a base-line. It is far too short to be used with
    safety in determining the distance of periods so remote as those which
    concern the geologist. But even supposing the palæontologist had a
    period of sufficient length measured off correctly to begin with, his
    results would still be unsatisfactory; for it is perfectly obvious,
    that unless the climatic conditions of the globe during the various
    periods were nearly the same, the rate at which the species change
    would certainly not be uniform; but such has not been the case, as an
    examination of the Tables of eccentricity will show. Take, for example,
    that long epoch of 260,000 years, beginning about 980,000 years ago
    and terminating about 720,000 years ago. During that long period the
    changes from cold to warm conditions of climate every 10,000 or 12,000
    years must have been of the most extreme character. Compare that
    period with the period beginning, say, 80,000 years ago, and extending
    to nearly 150,000 years into the future, during which there will be
    no extreme variations of climate, and how great is the contrast! How
    extensive the changes in species must have been during the first period
    as compared with those which are likely to take place during the latter!</p>

  <p>Besides, it must also be taken into consideration that organization was
    of a far more simple type in the earlier Palæozoic ages than during the
    Tertiary period, and would probably on this account change much more
    slowly in the former than in the latter.</p>

  <p>The foregoing considerations render it highly probable, if not
    certain, that the rate at which the general surface of the globe is
    being lowered by subaërial denudation cannot be much under one foot
    in 6,000 years. How, if we assign the glacial epoch to that period of
    high eccentricity beginning 980,000 years ago, and terminating 720,000
    years ago, then we must conclude that as much as 120 feet must have
    been denuded off the face of the country since the close of the glacial
    epoch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span> But if as much as this had been carried down by our rivers into
    the sea, hardly a patch of boulder clay, or any trace of the glacial
    epoch, should be now remaining on the land. It is therefore evident
    that the glacial epoch cannot be assigned to that remote period, but
    ought to be referred to the period terminating about 80,000 years ago.
    We have, in this latter case, 13 feet, equal to about 18 feet of drift,
    as the amount removed from the general surface of the country since
    the glacial epoch. This amount harmonizes very well with the direct
    evidence of geology on this point. Had the amount of denudation since
    the close of the glacial epoch been much greater than this, the drift
    deposits would not only have been far less complete, but the general
    appearance and outline of the surface of all glaciated countries would
    have been very different from what they really are.</p>

  <p><em>Circumstances which show the Recent Date of the Glacial Epoch.</em>—One
    of the circumstances to which I refer is this. When we examine the
    surface of any glaciated country, such as Scotland, we can easily
    satisfy ourselves that the upper surface of the ground differs very
    much from what it would have been had its external features been due
    to the action of rain and rivers and the ordinary agencies which have
    been at work since the close of the Ice period. Go where one will in
    the Lowlands of Scotland, and he shall hardly find a single acre whose
    upper surface bears the marks of being formed by the denuding agents
    which are presently in operation. He will observe everywhere mounds
    and hollows, the existence of which cannot be accounted for by the
    present agencies at work. In fact these agencies are slowly denuding
    pre-existing heights and silting up pre-existing hollows. Everywhere
    one comes upon patches of alluvium which upon examination prove to be
    simply old glacially formed hollows silted up. True, the main rivers,
    streams, and even brooks, occupy channels which have been formed by
    running water, either since or prior to the glacial epoch, but, in
    regard to the general surface of the country, the present agencies may
    be said to be just beginning to carve a new line of features out of
    the old glacially formed surface.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span> But so little progress has yet been
    made, that the kames, gravel mounds, knolls of boulder clay, &amp;c., still
    retain in most cases their original form. Now, when we reflect that
    more than a foot of drift is being removed from the general surface of
    the country every 5,000 years or so, it becomes perfectly obvious that
    the close of the glacial epoch must be of comparatively recent date.</p>

  <p>There is another circumstance which shows that the glacial epoch must
    be referred to the latest period of great eccentricity. If we refer the
    glacial epoch to the penultimate period of extreme eccentricity, and
    place its commencement one million of years back, then we must also
    lengthen out to a corresponding extent the entire geological history
    of the globe. Sir Charles Lyell, who is inclined to assign the glacial
    epoch to this penultimate period, considers that when we go back as far
    as the Lower Miocene formations, we arrive at a period when the marine
    shells differed as a whole from those now existing. But only 5 per
    cent. of the shells existing at the commencement of the glacial epoch
    have since died out. Hence, assuming the rate at which the species
    change to be uniform, it follows that the Lower Miocene period must
    be twenty times as remote as the commencement of the glacial epoch.
    Consequently, if it be one million of years since the commencement
    of the glacial epoch, 20 millions of years, Sir Charles concludes,
    must have elapsed since the time of the Lower Miocene period, and
    60 millions of years since the beginning of the Eocene period, and
    about 160 millions of years since the Carboniferous period, and about
    240 millions of years must be the time which has elapsed since the
    beginning of the Cambrian period. But, on the other hand, if we refer
    the glacial epoch to the latest period of great eccentricity, and take
    250,000 years ago as the beginning of that period, then, according
    to the same mode of calculation, we have 15 millions of years since
    the beginning of the Eocene period, and 40 millions of years since
    the Carboniferous period, and 60 millions of years in all since the
    beginning of the Cambrian period.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

  <p>If the beginning of the glacial epoch be carried back a million years,
    then it is probable, as Sir Charles Lyell concludes, that the beginning
    of the Cambrian period will require to be placed 240 millions of years
    back. But it is very probable that the length of time embraced by the
    pre-Cambrian ages of geological history may be as great as that which
    has elapsed since the close of the Cambrian period, and, if this be
    so, then we shall be compelled to admit that nearly 500 millions of
    years have passed away since the beginning of the earth’s geological
    history. But we have evidence of a physical nature which proves that it
    is absolutely impossible that the existing order of things, as regards
    our globe, can date so far back as anything like 500 millions of years.
    The arguments to which I refer are those which have been advanced by
    Professor Sir William Thomson at various times. These arguments are
    well known, and to all who have really given due attention to them must
    be felt to be conclusive. It would be superfluous to state them here; I
    shall, however, for reasons which will presently appear, refer briefly
    to one of them, and that one which seems to be the most conclusive of
    all, viz., the argument derived from the limit to the age of the sun’s

  <p><em>Professor Ramsay on Geological Time.</em>—In an interesting suggestive
    memoir, “On Geological Ages as items of Geological Time,”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
    Professor Ramsay discusses the comparative values of certain groups of
    formations as representative of geological time, and arrives at the
    following general conclusion, viz., “That the local continental era
    which began with the Old Red Sandstone and closed with the New Red Marl
    is comparable, in point of geological time, to that occupied in the
    deposition of the whole of the Mesozoic, or Secondary series, later
    than the New Red Marl and all the Cainozoic or Tertiary formations,
    and indeed of all the time that has elapsed since the beginning of
    the deposition of the Lias down to the present day.” This conclusion
    is derived partly from a comparison of the physical character of
    the formations constituting each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>group, but principally from the
    zoological changes which took place during the time represented by them.</p>

  <p>The earlier period represented by the Cambrian and Silurian rocks he
    also, from the same considerations, considers to have been very long,
    but he does not attempt to fix its relative length. Of the absolute
    length of any or all of these great eras of geological time no
    estimate or guess is given. He believes, however, that the whole time
    represented by all the fossiliferous rocks, from the earliest Cambrian
    to the most recent, is, geologically speaking, short compared with that
    which went before it. After quoting Professor Huxley’s enumeration of
    the many classes and orders of marine life (identical with those still
    existing), whose remains characterize the lowest Cambrian rocks, he
    says, “The inference is obvious that in this earliest known varied
    life we find no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of
    the zoological series. In a broad sense, compared with what must have
    gone before, both biologically and physically, all the phenomena
    connected with this old period seem to my mind to be quite of a recent
    description, and the climates of seas and lands were of the very same
    kind as those that the world enjoys at the present day.”... “In the
    words of Darwin, when discussing the imperfection of the geological
    record of this history, ‘we possess the last volume alone relating
    only to two or three countries,’ and the reason why we know so little
    of pre-Cambrian faunas and the physical characters of the more ancient
    formations as originally deposited, is that below the Cambrian strata
    we get at once involved in a sort of chaos of metamorphic strata.’”</p>

  <p>It seems to me that Professor Ramsay’s results lead to the same
    conclusion regarding the <em>positive</em> length of geological periods as
    those derived from physical considerations. It is true that his views
    lead us back to an immense lapse of unknown time prior to the Cambrian
    period, but this practically tends to shorten geological periods. For
    it is evident that the geological history of our globe must be limited
    by the age of the sun’s heat, no matter how long or short its age may
    be. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> being the case, the greater the length of time which must
    have elapsed prior to the Cambrian period, the less must be the time
    which has elapsed since that period. Whatever is added to the one
    period must be so much taken from the other. Consequently, the longer
    we suppose the pre-Cambrian periods to have been, the shorter must we
    suppose the post-Cambrian to be.</p>

    Heat.—Original Heat.—Source of Original Heat.—Original Heat

  <p><em>Gravitation Theory of the Origin and Source of the Sun’s Heat.</em>—There
    are two forms in which this theory has been presented: the first, the
    meteoric theory, propounded by Dr. Meyer, of Heilbronn; and the second,
    the contraction theory, advocated by Helmholtz.</p>

  <p>It is found that 83·4 foot-pounds of heat per second are incident upon
    a square foot of the earth’s surface exposed to the perpendicular rays
    of the sun. The amount radiated from a square foot of the sun’s surface
    is to that incident on a square foot of the earth’s surface as the
    square of the sun’s distance to the square of his radius, or as 46,400
    to 1. Consequently 3,869,000 foot-pounds of heat are radiated off every
    square foot of the sun’s surface per second—an amount equal to about
    7,000 horse power. The total amount radiated from the whole surface
    of the sun per annum is 8,340 × 10<sup>30</sup> foot-pounds. To maintain the
    present rate of radiation, it would require the combustion of about
    1,500 lbs. of coal per hour on every square foot of the sun’s surface;
    and were the sun composed of that material, it would be all consumed in
    less than 5,000 years. The opinion that the sun’s heat is maintained
    by combustion cannot be entertained for a single moment. A pound of
    coal falling into the sun from an infinite distance would produce by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
    its concussion more than 6,000 times the amount of heat that would be
    generated by its combustion.</p>

  <p>It is well known that the velocity with which a body falling from an
    infinite distance would reach the sun would be equal to that which
    would be generated by a constant force equal to the weight of the body
    at the sun’s surface operating through a space equal to the sun’s
    radius. One pound would at the sun’s surface weigh about 28 pounds.
    Taking the sun’s radius at 441,000 miles,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> the energy of a pound
    of matter falling into the sun from infinite space would equal that
    of a 28-pound weight descending upon the earth from an elevation of
    441,000 miles, supposing the force of gravity to be as great at that
    elevation as it is at the earth’s surface. It would amount to upwards
    of 65,000,000,000 foot-pounds. A better idea of this enormous amount
    of energy exerted by a one-pound weight falling into the sun will be
    conveyed by stating that it would be sufficient to raise 1,000 tons to
    a height of 5½ miles. It would project the <em>Warrior</em>, fully equipped
    with guns, stores, and ammunition, over the top of Ben Nevis.</p>

  <p>Gravitation is now generally admitted to be the only conceivable
    source of the sun’s heat. But if we attribute the energy of the sun to
    gravitation as a source, we assign it to a cause the value of which can
    be accurately determined. Prodigious as is the energy of a single pound
    of matter falling into the sun, nevertheless a range of mountains,
    consisting of 176 cubic miles of solid rock, falling into the sun,
    would maintain his heat for only a single second. A mass equal to that
    of the earth would maintain the heat for only 93 years, and a mass
    equal to that of the sun itself falling into the sun would afford but
    33,000,000 years’ sun-heat.</p>

  <p>It is quite possible, however, that a meteor may reach the sun with a
    velocity far greater than that which it could acquire by gravitation;
    for it might have been moving in a direct line towards the sun with
    an original velocity before coming under <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>the sensible influence of
    the sun’s attraction. In this case a greater amount of heat would
    be generated by the meteor than would have resulted from its merely
    falling into the sun under the influence of gravitation. But then
    meteors of this sort must be of rare occurrence. The meteoric theory
    of the sun’s heat has now been pretty generally abandoned for the
    contraction theory advanced by Helmholtz.</p>

  <p>Suppose, with Helmholtz, that the sun originally existed as a nebulous
    mass, filling the entire space presently occupied by the solar system
    and extending into space indefinitely beyond the outermost planet. The
    total amount of work in foot-pounds performed by gravitation in the
    condensation of this mass to an orb of the sun’s present size can be
    found by means of the following formula given by Helmholtz,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

  <div class="center">Work of condensation = <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>5</sub></span>
    × <span class="frac"><sup><i>r</i><sup>2</sup>M<sup>2</sup></sup><span>/</span><sub>R<i>m</i></sub></span> × <i>g</i>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">M is the mass of the sun, <i>m</i> the mass of the earth, R the sun’s
    radius, and <i>r</i> the earth’s radius. Taking M = 4230 × 10<sup>27</sup> lbs.,
    <i>m</i> = 11,920 × 10<sup>21</sup> lbs., R = 2,328,500,000 feet, and <i>r</i> =
    20,889,272 feet; we have then for the total amount of work performed by
    gravitation in foot-pounds,</p>

  <div class="center">
    Work = <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>/</span><sub>5</sub></span> ×
      <span class="frac"><sup>(20,889,272·5)<sup>2</sup> × (4230 × 10<sup>27</sup>)<sup>2</sup></sup><span>/</span><sub>2,328,500,000 × 11,920 × 10<sup>21</sup></sub></span>
  </div>

  <div class="center">= 168,790 × 10<sup>36</sup> foot-pounds.</div>

  <p class="noindent">The amount of heat thus produced by gravitation would suffice for
    nearly 20,237,500 years.</p>

  <p>These calculations are based upon the assumption that the density of
    the sun is uniform throughout. But it is highly probable that the sun’s
    density increases towards the centre, in which case the amount of work
    performed by gravitation would be somewhat more than the above.</p>

  <p>Some confusion has arisen in reference to this subject by the
    introduction of the question of the amount of the sun’s specific heat.
    If we simply consider the sun as an incandescent body <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>in the process
    of cooling, the question of the amount of the sun’s specific heat is
    of the utmost importance; because the absolute amount of heat which
    the sun is capable of giving out depends wholly upon his temperature
    and specific heat. In this case three things only are required: (1),
    the sun’s mass; (2), temperature of the mass; (3), specific heat of
    the mass. But if we are considering what is the absolute amount of
    heat which could have been given out by the sun on the hypothesis that
    gravitation, either according to the meteoric theory suggested by Meyer
    or according to the contraction theory advocated by Helmholtz, is the
    only source of his heat, then we have nothing whatever to do with any
    inquiries regarding the specific heat of the sun. This is evident
    because the absolute amount of work which gravitation can perform in
    the pulling of the particles of the sun’s mass together, is wholly
    independent of the specific heat of those particles. Consequently, the
    amount of energy in the form of heat thus imparted to the particles
    by gravity must also be wholly independent of specific heat. That is
    to say, the amount of heat imparted to a particle will be the same
    whatever may be its specific heat.</p>

  <p>Even supposing we limit the geological history of our globe to 100
    millions of years, it is nevertheless evident that gravitation will not
    account for the supply of the sun’s heat during so long a period. There
    must be some other source of much more importance than gravitation.
    What other source of energy greater than that of gravitation can there
    be? It is singular that the opinion should have become so common even
    among physicists, that there is no other conceivable source than
    gravitation from which a greater amount of heat could have been derived.</p>

  <p><em>The Origin and Chief Source of the Sun’s Heat.</em>—According to the
    foregoing theories regarding the source of the sun’s heat, it is
    assumed that the matter composing the sun, when it existed in space as
    a nebulous mass, was not originally possessed of temperature, but that
    the temperature was given to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> as the mass became condensed under the
    force of gravitation. It is supposed that the heat given out was simply
    the heat of condensation. But it is quite conceivable that the nebulous
    mass might have been possessed of an original store of heat previous to
    condensation.</p>

  <p>It is quite possible that the very reason why it existed in such a
    rarefied or gaseous condition was its excessive temperature, and that
    condensation only began to take place when the mass began to cool down.
    It seems far more probable that this should have been the case than
    that the mass existed in so rarefied a condition without temperature.
    For why should the particles have existed in this separated form when
    devoid of the repulsive energy of heat, seeing that in virtue of
    gravitation they had such a tendency to approach to one another? But
    if the mass was originally in a heated condition, then in condensing
    it would have to part not only with the heat generated in condensing,
    but also with the heat which it originally possessed, a quantity
    which would no doubt much exceed that produced by condensation. To
    illustrate this principle, let us suppose a pound of air, for example,
    to be placed in a cylinder and heat applied to it. If the piston be so
    fixed that it cannot move, 234·5 foot-pounds of heat will raise the
    temperature of the air 1° C. But if the piston be allowed to rise as
    the heat is applied, then it will require 330·2 foot-pounds of heat to
    raise the temperature 1° C. It requires 95·7 foot-pounds more heat in
    the latter case than in the former. The same amount of energy, viz.,
    234·5 foot-pounds, in both cases goes to produce temperature; but in
    the latter case, where the piston is allowed to move, 95·7 foot-pounds
    of additional heat are consumed in the mechanical work of raising the
    piston. Suppose, now, that the air is allowed to cool under the same
    conditions: in the one case 234·5 foot-pounds of heat will be given
    out while the temperature of the air sinks 1° C.; in the other case,
    where the piston is allowed to descend, 330·2 foot-pounds will be given
    out while the temperature sinks 1° C. In the former case, the air in
    cooling has simply to part with the energy which it possesses <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>in
    the form of temperature; but in the latter case it has, in addition
    to this, to part with the energy bestowed upon its molecules by the
    descending piston. While the temperature of the gas is sinking 1°,
    95·7 foot-pounds of energy in the form of heat are being imparted to
    it by the descending piston; and these have to be got rid of before
    the temperature is lowered by 1°. Consequently 234·5 foot-pounds of
    the heat given out previously existed in the air under the form of
    temperature, and the remaining 95·7 foot-pounds given out were imparted
    to the air by the descending piston while the gas was losing its
    temperature. 234·5 foot-pounds represent the energy or heat which the
    air previously possessed, and 95·7 the energy or heat of condensation.</p>

  <p>In the case of the cooling of the sun from a nebulous mass, there
    would of course be no external force or pressure exerted on the mass
    analogous to that of the piston on the air; but there would be, what
    is equivalent to the same, the gravitation of the particles to each
    other. There would be the pressure of the whole mass towards the centre
    of convergence. In the case of air, and all perfect gases cooling
    under pressure, about 234 foot-pounds of the original heat possessed
    by the gas are given out while 95 foot-pounds are being generated by
    condensation. We have, however, no reason whatever to believe that in
    the case of the cooling of the sun the same proportions would hold
    true. The proportion of original heat possessed by the mass of the sun
    to that produced by condensation may have been much greater than 234 to
    95, or it may have been much less. In the absence of all knowledge on
    this point, we may in the meantime assume that to be the proportion.
    The total quantity of heat given out by the sun resulting from the
    condensation of his mass, on the supposition that the density of the
    sun is uniform throughout, we have seen to be equal to 20,237,500
    years’ sun-heat. Then the quantity of heat given out, which previously
    existed in the mass as original temperature, must have been 49,850,000
    years’ heat, making in all 70,087,500 years’ heat as the total amount.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

  <p>The above quantity represents, of course, the total amount of heat
    given out by the mass since it began to condense. But the geological
    history of our globe must date its beginning at a period posterior to
    that. For at that time the mass would probably occupy a much greater
    amount of space than is presently possessed by the entire solar system;
    and consequently, before it had cooled down to within the limits of
    the earth’s present orbit, our earth could not have had an existence
    as a separate planet. Previously to that time it must have existed as
    a portion of the sun’s fiery mass. If we assume that it existed as a
    globe previously to that, and came in from space after the condensation
    of the sun, then it is difficult to conceive how its orbit should be so
    nearly circular as it is at present.</p>

  <p>Let us assume that by the time that the mass of the sun had condensed
    to within the space encircled by the orbit of the planet Mercury (that
    is, to a sphere having, say, a radius of 18,000,000 miles) the earth’s
    crust began to form; and let this be the time when the geological
    history of our globe dates its commencement. The total amount of heat
    generated by the condensation of the sun’s mass from a sphere of this
    size to its present volume would equal 19,740,000 years’ sun-heat.
    The amount of original heat given out during that time would equal
    48,625,000 years’ sun-heat,—thus giving a total of 68,365,000 years’
    sun-heat enjoyed by our globe since that period. The total quantity may
    possibly, of course, be considerably more than that, owing to the fact
    that the sun’s density may increase greatly towards his centre. But we
    should require to make extravagant assumptions regarding the interior
    density of the sun and the proportion of original heat to that produced
    by condensation before we could manage to account for anything like the
    period that geological phenomena are supposed by some to demand.</p>

  <p>The question now arises, by what conceivable means could the mass of
    the sun have become possessed of such a prodigious amount of energy
    in the form of heat previous to condensation?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> What power could have
    communicated to the mass 50,000,000 years’ heat before condensation
    began to take place?</p>

  <p><em>The Sun’s Energy may have originally been derived from Motion in
    Space.</em>—There is nothing at all absurd or improbable in the supposition
    that such an amount of energy might have been communicated to the
    mass. The Dynamical Theory of Heat affords an easy explanation of at
    least <em>how</em> such an amount of energy <em>may</em> have been communicated. Two
    bodies, each one-half the mass of the sun, moving directly towards
    each other with a velocity of 476 miles per second, would by their
    concussion generate in a <em>single moment</em> the 50,000,000 years’ heat.
    For two bodies of that mass moving with a velocity of 476 miles per
    second would possess 4149 × 10<sup>38</sup> foot-pounds of energy in the form
    of <i lang="la">vis viva</i>; and this, converted into heat by the stoppage of their
    motion, would give an amount of heat which would cover the present rate
    of the sun’s radiation, for a period of 50,000,000 years.</p>

  <p>Why may not the sun have been composed of two such bodies? And why may
    not the original store of heat possessed by him have all been derived
    from the concussion of these two bodies? Two such bodies coming into
    collision with that velocity would be dissipated into vapour by such
    an inconceivable amount of heat as would thus be generated; and when
    they condensed on cooling, they would form one spherical mass like the
    sun. It is perfectly true that two such bodies could never attain the
    required amount of velocity by their mutual gravitation towards each
    other. But there is no necessity whatever for supposing that their
    velocities were derived from their mutual attraction alone. They might
    have been approaching towards each other with the required velocity
    wholly independent of gravitation.</p>

  <p>We know nothing whatever regarding the absolute motion of bodies in
    space. And beyond the limited sphere of our observation, we know
    nothing even of their relative motions. There may be bodies moving
    in relation to our system with inconceivable velocity. For anything
    that we know to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> contrary, were one of these bodies to strike our
    earth, the shock might be sufficient to generate an amount of heat that
    would dissipate the earth into vapour, though the striking body might
    not be heavier than a cannon-ball. There is, however, nothing very
    extraordinary in the velocity which we have found would be required
    in the two supposed bodies to generate the 50,000,000 years’ heat. A
    comet, having an orbit extending to the path of the planet Neptune,
    approaching so near the sun as to almost graze his surface in passing,
    would have a velocity of about 390 miles per second, which is within 86
    miles of the required velocity.</p>

  <p>But in the original heating and expansion of the sun into a gaseous
    mass, an amount of work must have been performed against gravitation
    equal to that which has been performed by gravitation during his
    cooling and condensation, a quantity which we have found amounts to
    about 20,000,000 years’ heat. The total amount of energy originally
    communicated by the concussion must have been equal to 70,000,000
    years’ sun-heat. A velocity of 563 miles per second would give this
    amount. It must be borne in mind, however, that the 563 miles per
    second is the velocity at the moment of collision; about one-half of
    this velocity would be derived from the mutual attraction of the two
    bodies in their approach to each other. Suppose each body to be equal
    in volume to the sun, and of course one-half the density, the amount
    of velocity which they would acquire by their mutual attraction would
    be 274 miles per second, consequently we have to assume an original or
    projected velocity of only 289 miles per second.</p>

  <p>If we admit that gravitation is not sufficient to account for the
    amount of heat given out by the sun during the geological history of
    our globe, we are compelled to assume that the mass of which the sun is
    composed existed prior to condensation in a heated condition; and if
    so, we are further obliged to admit that the mass must have received
    its heat from some source or other. And as the dissipation of heat into
    space must have been going on, in all probability, as rapidly before
    as after condensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> took place, we are further obliged to conclude
    that the heat must have been communicated to the mass immediately
    before condensation began, for the moment the mass began to lose its
    heat condensation would ensue. If we confine our speculations to causes
    and agencies known to exist, the cause which has been assigned appears
    to be the only conceivable one that will account for the production of
    such an enormous amount of heat.</p>

  <p>The general conclusion to which we are therefore led from physical
    considerations regarding the age of the sun’s heat is, that the entire
    geological history of our globe must be comprised within less than
    100 millions of years, and that consequently the commencement of the
    glacial epoch cannot date much farther back than 240,000 years.</p>

  <p>The facts of geology, more especially those in connection with
    denudation, seem to geologists to require a period of much longer
    duration than 100 millions of years, and it is this which has so
    long prevented them accepting the conclusions of physical science in
    regard to the age of our globe. But the method of measuring subaërial
    denudation already detailed seems to me to show convincingly that the
    geological data, when properly interpreted, are in perfect accord with
    the deductions of physical science. Perhaps there are now few who
    have fairly considered the question who will refuse to admit that 100
    millions of years are amply sufficient to comprise the whole geological
    history of our globe.</p>

  <p><em>A false Analogy supposed to exist between Astronomy and
    Geology.</em>—Perhaps one of the things which has tended to mislead on
    this point is a false analogy which is supposed to subsist between
    astronomy and geology, viz., that geology deals with unlimited <em>time</em>,
    as astronomy deals with unlimited <em>space</em>. A little consideration,
    however, will show that there is not much analogy between the two cases.</p>

  <p>Astronomy deals with the countless worlds which lie spread out in the
    boundless infinity of space; but geology deals with only one world.
    No doubt reason and analogy both favour the idea that the age of the
    material universe, like its magnitude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span> is immeasurable; we have no
    reason, however, to conclude that it is eternal, any more than we
    have to infer that it is infinite. But when we compare the age of the
    material universe with its magnitude, we must not take the age of one
    of its members (say, our globe) and compare it with the size of the
    universe. Neither must we compare the age of all the presently existing
    systems of worlds with the magnitude of the universe; but we must
    compare the past history of the universe as it stretches back into the
    immensity of bygone <em>time</em>, with the presently existing universe as it
    stretches out on all sides into limitless <em>space</em>. For worlds precede
    worlds in time as worlds lie beyond worlds in space. Each world,
    each individual, each atom is evidently working out a final purpose,
    according to a plan prearranged and predetermined by the Divine Mind
    from all eternity. And each world, like each individual, when it
    serves the end for which it was called into existence, disappears to
    make room for others. This is the grand conception of the universe
    which naturally impresses itself on every thoughtful mind that has not
    got into confusion about those things called in science the Laws of
    Nature.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

  <p>But the geologist does not pass back from world to world as they stand
    related to each other in the order of <em>succession in time</em>, as the
    astronomer passes from world to world as they stand related to each
    other in the order of <em>coexistence in space</em>. The researches of the
    geologist, moreover, are not only confined to one world, but it is only
    a portion of the history of that one world that can come under his
    observation. The oldest of existing formations, so far as is yet known,
    the Laurentian Gneiss, is made up of the waste of previously existing
    rocks, and it, again, has probably been derived from the degradation
    of rocks belonging to some still older period. Regarding what succeeds
    these old Laurentian rocks geology tells us much; but of the formations
    that preceded, we know nothing whatever. For anything that geology
    shows to the contrary, the time which may have elapsed from the
    solidifying of the earth’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>crust to the deposition of the Laurentian
    strata—an absolute blank—may have been as great as the time that has
    since intervened.</p>

  <p><em>Probable Date of the Eocene and Miocene Periods.</em>—If we take into
    consideration the limit which physical science assigns to the age of
    our globe, and the rapid rate at which, as we have seen, denudation
    takes place, it becomes evident that the enormous period of 3 millions
    of years comprehended in the foregoing tables must stretch far back
    into the Tertiary age. Supposing that the mean rate of denudation
    during that period was not greater than the present rate of denudation,
    still we should have no less than 500 feet of rock worn off the face of
    the country and carried into the sea during these 3 millions of years.
    This fact shows how totally different the appearance and configuration
    of the country in all probability was at the commencement of this
    period from what it is at the present day. If it be correct that the
    glacial epoch resulted from the causes which we have already discussed,
    those tables ought to aid us in our endeavour to ascertain <em>how</em> much
    of the Tertiary period may be comprehended within these 3 millions of
    years.</p>

  <p>We have already seen (<a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII.</a>) that there is evidence of a
    glacial condition of climate at two different periods during the
    Tertiary age, namely, about the middle of the Miocene and Eocene
    periods respectively. As has already been shown, the more severe a
    glacial epoch is, the more marked ought to be the character of its warm
    inter-glacial periods; the greater the extension of the ice during the
    cold periods of a glacial epoch the further should that ice disappear
    in arctic regions during the corresponding warm periods. Thus the
    severity of a glacial epoch may in this case be indirectly inferred
    from the character of the warm periods and the extent to which the
    ice may have disappeared from arctic regions. Judged by this test, we
    have every reason to believe that the Miocene glacial epoch was one of
    extreme severity.</p>

  <p>The Eocene conglomerate, devoid of all organic remains, and containing
    numerous enormous ice-transported blocks, is, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> have seen,
    immediately associated with nummulitic strata charged with fossils
    characteristic of a warm climate. Referring to this Sir Charles Lyell
    says, “To imagine icebergs carrying such huge fragments of stone in so
    southern a latitude, and at a period immediately preceded and followed
    by the signs of a warm climate, is one of the most perplexing enigmas
    which the geologist has yet been called upon to solve.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

  <p>It is perfectly true that, according to the generally received theories
    of the cause of a glacial climate the whole is a perplexing enigma, but
    if we adopt the Secular theory of change of climate, every difficulty
    disappears. According to this theory the very fact of the conglomerate
    being formed at a period immediately preceded and succeeded by warm
    conditions of climate, is of itself strong presumptive evidence of the
    conglomerate being a glacial formation. But this is not all, the very
    highness of the temperature of the preceding and succeeding periods
    bears testimony to the severity of the intervening glacial period.
    Despite the deficiency of direct evidence regarding the character of
    the Miocene and Eocene glacial periods, we are not warranted, for
    reasons which have been stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter XVII.</a>, to conclude that these
    periods were less severe than the one which happened in Quaternary
    times. Judging from indirect evidence, we have some grounds for
    concluding that the Miocene glacial epoch at least was even more severe
    and protracted than our recent glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>By referring to <a href="#TABLE_III">Table III.</a>, or the accompanying diagram, it will be seen
    that prior to the period which I have assigned as that of the glacial
    epoch, there are two periods when the eccentricity almost attained
    its superior limit. The first period occurred 2,500,000 years ago,
    when it reached 0·0721, and the second period 850,000 years ago, when
    it attained a still higher value, viz., 0·0747, being within 0·0028
    of the superior limit. To the first of these periods I am disposed
    to assign the glacial epoch of Eocene times, and to the second that
    of the Miocene age. With the view of determining the character of
    these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>periods <a href="#TABLE_II">Tables II.</a> and <a href="#TABLE_III">III.</a> have been computed. They give the
    eccentricity and longitude of perihelion at intervals of 10,000 years.
    It will be seen from <a href="#TABLE_II">Table II.</a> that the Eocene period extends from
    about 2,620,000 to about 2,460,000 years ago; and from <a href="#TABLE_III">Table III.</a> it
    will be gathered that the Miocene period lasted from about 980,000 to
    about 720,000 years ago.</p>

  <p>In order to find whether the eccentricity attained a higher value about
    850,000 years ago than 0·0747, I computed the values for one or two
    periods immediately before and after that period, and satisfied myself
    that the value stated was indeed the highest, as will be seen from the
    subjoined table:—</p>

  <table summary="Eccentricity ">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>851,000</td>
        <td>0·07454</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>850,000</td>
        <td>0·074664</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>849,500</td>
        <td>0·07466</td>
      </tr>

        <td>849,000</td>
        <td>0·07466</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>How totally different must have been the condition of the earth’s
    climate at that period from what it is at present! Taking the mean
    distance of the sun to be 91,400,000 miles, his present distance at
    midwinter is 89,864,480 miles; but at the period in question, when the
    winter solstice was in perihelion, his distance at midwinter would be
    no less than 98,224,289 miles. But this is not all; our winters are at
    present shorter than our summers by 7·8 days, but at that period they
    would be longer than the summers by 34·7 days.</p>

  <p>At present the difference between the perihelion and aphelion distance
    of the sun amounts to only 3,069,580 miles, but at the period under
    consideration it would amount to no less than 13,648,579 miles!</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Various</span> attempts have been made to measure the positive length of
    geological periods. Some geologists have sought to determine, roughly,
    the age of the stratified rocks by calculations based upon their
    probable thickness and the rate at which they may have been deposited.
    This method, however, is worthless, because the rates which have been
    adopted are purely arbitrary. One geologist will take the rate of
    deposit at a foot in a hundred years, while another will assume it
    to be a foot in a thousand or perhaps ten thousand years; and, for
    any reasons that have been assigned, the one rate is just as likely
    to be correct as the other: for if we examine what is taking place
    in the ocean-bed at the present day, we shall find in some places a
    foot of sediment laid down in a year, while in other places a foot
    may not be deposited in a thousand years. The stratified rocks were
    evidently formed at all possible rates. When we speak of the rate of
    their formation, we must of course refer to the <em>mean rate</em>; and it is
    perfectly true that if we knew the thickness of these rocks and the
    mean rate at which they were deposited, we should have a ready means
    of determining their positive age. But there appears to be nearly as
    great uncertainty regarding the thickness of the sedimentary rocks as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
    regarding the rate at which they were formed. No doubt we can roughly
    estimate their probable maximum thickness; for instance, Professor
    Ramsay has found from actual measurement, that the sedimentary
    formations of Great Britain have a maximum thickness of upwards of
    72,000 feet; but all such measurements give us no idea of their mean
    thickness. What is the mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks of
    the globe? On this point geology does not afford a definite answer.
    Whatever the present mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks of our
    globe may be, it must be small in comparison to the mean thickness
    of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed. This is obvious
    from the fact that the sedimentary rocks of one age are partly formed
    from the destruction of the sedimentary rocks of former ages. From the
    Laurentian age down to the present day, the stratified rocks have been
    undergoing constant denudation.</p>

  <p>Unless we take into consideration the quantity of rock removed during
    past ages by denudation, we cannot—even though we knew the actual mean
    thickness of the existing sedimentary rocks of the globe, and the rate
    at which they were formed—arrive at an estimate regarding the length of
    time represented by these rocks. For if we are to determine the age of
    the stratified rocks from the rate at which they were formed, we must
    have, not the present quantity of sedimentary rocks, but the present
    plus the quantity which has been denuded during past ages. In other
    words, we must have the absolute quantity formed. In many places the
    missing beds must have been of enormous thickness. The time represented
    by beds which have disappeared is, doubtless, as already remarked,
    much greater than that represented by the beds which now remain. The
    greater mass of the sedimentary rocks has been formed out of previously
    existing sedimentary rocks, and these again out of sedimentary rocks
    still older. As the materials composing our stratified beds may have
    passed through many cycles of destruction and re-formation, the time
    required to have deposited at a given rate the present existing mass
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> sedimentary rocks may be but a fraction of the time required to
    have deposited at the same rate the total mass that has actually been
    formed. To measure the age of the sedimentary rocks by the present
    existing rocks, assumed to be formed at some given rate, even supposing
    the rate to be correct, is a method wholly fallacious.</p>

  <p>“The aggregate of sedimentary strata in the earth’s crust,” says Sir
    Charles Lyell, “can never exceed in volume the amount of solid matter
    which has been ground down and washed away by rivers, waves, and
    currents. How vast, then, must be the spaces which this abstraction
    of matter has left vacant! How far exceeding in dimensions all the
    valleys, however numerous, and the hollows, however vast, which we can
    prove to have been cleared out by aqueous erosion!”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

  <p>I presume there are few geologists who would not admit that if all the
    rocks which have in past ages been removed by denudation were restored,
    the mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the globe would be at
    least equal to their present maximum thickness, which we may take at
    72,000 feet.</p>

  <p>There are three elements in the question; of which if two are known,
    the third is known in terms of the other two. If we have the mean
    thickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed and the
    mean rate of formation, then we have the time which elapsed during the
    formation; or having the thickness and the time, we have the rate; or,
    having the rate and the time, we have the thickness.</p>

  <p>One of these three, namely, the rate, can, however, be determined with
    tolerable accuracy if we are simply allowed to assume—what is very
    probable, as has already been shown—that the present rate at which the
    sedimentary deposits are being formed may be taken as the mean rate
    for past ages. If we know the rate at which the land is being denuded,
    then we know with perfect accuracy the rate at which the sedimentary
    deposits are being formed in the ocean. This is obvious, because all
    the materials denuded from the land are deposited in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>the sea; and
    what is deposited in the sea is just what comes off the land, with the
    exception of the small proportion of calcareous matter which may not
    have been derived from the land, and which in our rough estimate may be
    left out of account.</p>

  <p>Now the mean rate of subaërial denudation, we have seen, is about one
    foot in 6,000 years. Taking the proportion of land to that of water
    at 576 to 1,390, then one foot taken off the land and spread over the
    sea-bottom would form a layer 5 inches thick. Consequently, if one foot
    in 6,000 years represents the mean rate at which the land is being
    denuded, one foot in 14,400 years represents the mean rate at which the
    sedimentary rocks are being formed.</p>

  <p>Assuming, as before, that 72,000 feet would represent the mean
    thickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have ever been formed,
    this, at the rate of one foot in 14,400 years, gives 1,036,800,000
    years as the age of the stratified rocks.</p>

  <p>Professor Huxley, in his endeavour to show that 100,000,000 years is
    a period sufficiently long for all the demands of geologists, takes
    the thickness of the stratified rocks at 100,000 feet, and the rate
    of deposit at a foot in 1,000 years. One foot of rock per 1,000 years
    gives, it is true, 100,000 feet in 100,000,000 years. But what about
    the rocks which have disappeared? If it takes a hundred millions of
    years to produce a mass of rock equal to that which now exists, how
    many hundreds of millions of years will it require to produce a mass
    equal to what has actually been produced?</p>

  <p>Professor Huxley adds, “I do not know that any one is prepared to
    maintain that the stratified rocks may not have been formed on the
    average at the rate of 1/83rd of an inch per annum.” When the rate,
    however, is accurately determined, it is found to be, not 1/83rd of
    an inch per annum, but only 1/1200th of an inch, so that the 100,000
    feet of rock must have taken 1,440,000,000 years in its formation,—a
    conclusion which, according to the results of modern physics, is wholly
    inadmissible.</p>

  <p>Either the thickness of the sedimentary rocks has been over-estimated,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>or the rate of their formation has been under-estimated, or both.
    If it be maintained that a foot in 14,400 years is too slow a rate
    of deposit, then it must be maintained that the land must have been
    denuded at a greater rate than one foot in 6,000 years. But most
    geologists probably felt surprised when the announcement was first
    made, that at this rate of denudation the whole existing land of the
    globe would be brought under the ocean in 6,000,000 of years.</p>

  <p>The error, no doubt, consists in over-estimating the thickness of the
    sedimentary rocks. Assuming, for physical reasons already stated, that
    100,000,000 years limits the age of the stratified rocks, and that the
    proportion of land to water and the rate of denudation have been on the
    average the same as at present, the mean thickness of sedimentary rocks
    formed in the 100,000,000 years amounts to only 7,000 feet.</p>

  <p>But be it observed that this is the mean thickness on an area equal
    to that of the ocean. Over the area of the globe it amounts to only
    5,000 feet; and this, let it be observed also, is the total mean
    thickness formed, without taking into account what has been removed
    by denudation. If we wish to ascertain what is actually the present
    mean thickness, we must deduct from this 5,000 feet an amount of rock
    equal to all the sedimentary rocks which have been denuded during
    the 100,000,000 years; for the 5,000 feet is not the present mean
    thickness, but the total mean thickness formed during the whole of the
    100,000,000 years. If we assume, what no doubt most geologists would be
    willing to grant, that the quantity of sedimentary rocks now remaining
    is not over one-half of what has been actually deposited during the
    history of the globe, then the actual mean thickness of the stratified
    rocks of the globe is not over 2,500 feet. This startling result would
    almost necessitate us to suspect that the rate of subaërial denudation
    is probably greater than one foot in 6,000 years. But, be this as it
    may, we are apt, in estimating the mean thickness of the stratified
    rocks of the globe from their ascertained maximum thickness, to arrive
    at erroneous conclusions. There are considerations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span> which show that
    the mean thickness of these rocks must be small in proportion to their
    maximum thickness. The stratified rocks are formed from the sediment
    carried down by rivers and streamlets and deposited in the sea. It is
    obvious that the greater quantity of this sediment is deposited near
    the mouths of rivers, and along a narrow margin extending to no great
    distance from the land. Did the land consist of numerous small islands
    equally distributed over the globe, the sediment carried off from these
    islands would be spread pretty equally over the sea-bottom. But the
    greater part of the land-surface consists of two immense continents.
    Consequently, the materials removed by denudation are not spread
    over the ocean-bottom, but on a narrow fringe surrounding those two
    continents. Were the materials spread over the entire ocean-bed, a foot
    removed off the general surface of the land would form a layer of rock
    only five inches thick. But in the way in which the materials are at
    present deposited, the foot removed from the land would form a layer
    of rock many feet in thickness. The greater part of the sediment is
    deposited within a few miles of the shore.</p>

  <p>The entire coast-line of the globe is about 116,500 miles. I should
    think that the quantity of sediment deposited beyond, say, 100 miles
    from this coast-line is not very great. No doubt several of the large
    rivers carry sediment to a much greater distance from their mouths than
    100 miles, and ocean currents may in some cases carry mud and other
    materials also to great distances. But it must be borne in mind that
    at many places within the 100 miles of this immense coast-line little
    or no sediment is deposited, so that the actual area over which the
    sediment carried off the land is deposited is probably not greater than
    the area of this belt—116,500 miles long and 100 miles broad. This
    area on which the sediment is deposited, on the above supposition, is
    therefore equal to about 11,650,000 square miles. The amount of land on
    the globe is about 57,600,000 square miles. Consequently, one foot of
    rock, denuded from the surface of the land and deposited on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span> belt,
    would make a stratum of rock 5 feet in thickness; but were the sediment
    spread over the entire bed of the ocean, it would form, as has already
    been stated, a stratum of rock of only 5 inches in thickness.</p>

  <p>Suppose that no subsidence of the land should take place for a period
    of, say, 3,000,000 of years. During that period 500 feet would be
    removed by denudation, on an average, off the land. This would make a
    formation 2,500 feet thick, which some future geologist might call the
    Post-tertiary formation. But this, be it observed, would be only the
    mean thickness of the formation on this area; its maximum thickness
    would evidently be much greater, perhaps twice, thrice, or even four
    times that thickness. A geologist in the future, measuring the actual
    thickness of the formation, might find it in some places 10,000 feet
    in thickness, or perhaps far more. But had the materials been spread
    over the entire ocean-bed, the formation would have a mean thickness
    of little more than 200 feet; and spread over the entire surface of
    the globe, would form a stratum of scarcely 150 feet in thickness.
    Therefore, in estimating the mean thickness of the stratified rocks of
    the globe, a formation with a maximum thickness of 10,000 feet may not
    represent more than 150 feet. A formation with a <em>mean</em> thickness of
    10,000 feet represents only 600 feet.</p>

  <p>It may be objected that in taking the present rate at which the
    sedimentary deposits are being formed as the mean rate for all ages,
    we probably under-estimate the total amount of rock formed, because
    during the many glacial periods which must have occurred in past ages
    the amount of materials ground off the rocky surface of the land in a
    given period would be far greater than at present. But, in reply, it
    must be remembered that although the destruction in ice-covered regions
    would be greater during these periods than at present, yet the quantity
    of materials carried down by rivers into the sea would be less. At
    the present day the greater part of the materials carried down by our
    rivers is not what is being removed off the rocky face of the country,
    but the boulder clay, sand, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span> materials which were ground off
    during the glacial epoch. It is therefore possible, on this account,
    that the rate of deposit may have been less during the glacial epoch
    than at present.</p>

  <p>When any particular formation is wanting in a given area, the inference
    generally drawn is, that either the formation has been denuded off
    the area, or the area was a land-surface during the period when that
    formation was being deposited. From the foregoing it will be seen that
    this inference is not legitimate; for, supposing that the area had been
    under water, the chances that materials should have been deposited on
    that area are far less than are the chances that there should not.
    There are sixteen chances against one that no formation ever existed in
    the area.</p>

  <p>If the great depressions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans
    be, for example, as old as the beginning of the Laurentian period—and
    they may be so for anything which geology can show to the contrary—then
    under these oceans little or no stratified rocks may exist. The
    supposition that the great ocean basins are of immense antiquity, and
    that consequently only a small proportion of the sedimentary strata
    can possibly occupy the deeper bed of the sea, acquires still more
    probability when we consider the great extent and thickness of the
    Old Red Sandstone, the Permian, and other deposits, which, according
    to Professor Ramsay and others, have been accumulated in vast inland
    lakes.</p>

  <p><em>Displacement of the Earth’s Centre of Gravity by Polar
    Ice-cap.</em><a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>—In order to represent the question in its most simple
    elementary form, I shall assume an ice-cap of a given thickness at the
    pole and gradually diminishing in thickness towards the equator in the
    simple proportion of the sines of the latitudes, where at the equator
    its thickness of course is zero. Let us assume, what is actually the
    case, that the equatorial diameter of the globe is somewhat greater
    than the polar, but that when the ice-cap is placed on one hemisphere
    the whole forms a perfect sphere.</p>

  <p>I shall begin with a period of glaciation on the southern hemisphere.
    Let W N E S′ (Fig. 5) be the solid part of the earth, and <i>c</i> its
    centre of gravity. And let E S W be an ice-cap covering the southern
    hemisphere. Let us in the first case assume the earth to be of the same
    density as the cap. The earth with its cap forms now a perfect sphere
    with its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>centre of gravity at <i>o</i>; for W N E S is a circle, and <i>o</i>
    is its centre. Suppose now the whole to be covered with an ocean a few
    miles deep, the ocean will assume the spherical form, and will be of
    uniform depth. Let the southern winter solstice begin now to move round
    from the aphelion. The ice-cap will also commence gradually to diminish
    in thickness, and another cap will begin to make its appearance on
    the northern hemisphere. As the northern cap may be supposed, for
    simplicity of calculation, to increase at the same rate that the
    southern will diminish, the spherical form of the earth will always be
    maintained. By the time that the northern cap has reached a maximum,
    the southern cap will have completely disappeared. The circle W N′ E S′
    will now represent the earth with its cap on the northern hemisphere,
    and <i>o′</i> will be its centre of gravity; for <i>o′</i> is the centre of the
    circle W N′ E S′. And as the distance between the centres <i>o</i> and
    <i>o′</i> is equal to N N′, the thickness of the cap at the pole N N′ will
    therefore represent the extent to which the centre of gravity has been
    displaced. It will also represent the extent to which the ocean has
    risen at the north pole and sunk at the south. This is evident; for as
    the sphere W N′ E S′ is the same in all respects as the sphere W N E
    S, with the exception only that the cap is on the opposite side, the
    surface of the ocean at the poles will now be at the same distance from
    the centre <i>o′</i> as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span> was from the centre <i>o</i> when the cap covered
    the southern hemisphere. Hence the distance between <i>o</i> and <i>o′</i> must
    be equal to the extent of the submergence at the north pole and the
    emergence at the south. Neglect the attraction of the altering water on
    the water itself, which later on will come under our consideration.</p>

    <div class="caption mb2">Fig. 5.</div>
    <img src="images/i_369.jpg" width="350" height="315" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>We shall now consider the result when the earth is taken at its actual
    density, which is generally believed to be about 5·5. The density
    of ice being ·92, the density of the cap to that of the earth will
    therefore be as 1 to 6.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_370" >
    <div class="caption mb2">Fig. 6.</div>
    <img src="images/i_370.jpg" width="350" height="342" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Let Fig. 6 represent the earth with an ice-cap on the northern
    hemisphere, whose thickness is, say, 6,000 feet at the pole. The centre
    of gravity of the earth without the cap is at <i>c</i>. When the cap is on,
    the centre of gravity is shifted to <i>o</i>, a point a little more than
    500 feet to the north of <i>c</i>. Had the cap and the earth been of equal
    density, the centre of gravity would have been shifted to <i>o′</i> the
    centre of the figure, a point situated, of course, 3,000 feet to the
    north of <i>c</i>. Now it is very approximately true that the ocean will
    tend to adjust itself as a sphere around the centre of gravity, <i>o</i>.
    Thus it would of course sink at the south pole and rise to the same
    extent at the north, in any opening or channel in the ice allowing the
    water to enter.</p>

  <p>Let the ice-cap be now transferred over to the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span> hemisphere,
    and the condition of things on the two hemispheres will in every
    particular be reversed. The centre of gravity will then lie to
    the south of <i>c</i>, or about 1,000 feet from its former position.
    Consequently the transference of the cap from the one hemisphere to the
    other will produce a total submergence of about 1,000 feet.</p>

  <p>It is, of course, absurd to suppose that an ice-cap could ever actually
    reach down to the equator. It is probable that the great ice-cap of the
    glacial epoch nowhere reached even halfway to the equator. Our cap must
    therefore terminate at a moderately high latitude. Let it terminate
    somewhere about the latitude of the north of England, say at latitude
    55°. All that we have to do now is simply to imagine our cap, up to
    that latitude, becoming converted into the fluid state. This would
    reduce the cap to less than one-half its former mass. But it would not
    diminish the submergence to anything like that extent. For although the
    cap would be reduced to less than one-half its former mass, yet its
    influence in displacing the centre of gravity would not be diminished
    to that extent. This is evident; for the cap now extending down to
    only latitude 55°, has its centre of gravity much farther removed from
    the earth’s centre of gravity than it had when it extended down to the
    equator. Consequently it now possesses, in proportion to its mass, a
    much greater power in displacing the earth’s centre of gravity.</p>

  <p>There is another fact which must be taken into account. The common
    centre of gravity of the earth and cap is not exactly the point
    around which the ocean tends to adjust itself. It adjusts itself not
    in relation to the centre of gravity of the solid mass alone, but in
    relation to the common centre of gravity of the entire mass, solid and
    liquid. Now the water which is pulled over from the one hemisphere to
    the other by the attraction of the cap will also aid in displacing the
    centre of gravity. It will co-operate with the cap and carry the true
    centre of gravity to a point beyond that of the centre of gravity of
    the earth and cap, and thus increase the effect.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

  <p>It is of course perfectly true that when the ice-cap does not extend
    down to the equator, as in the latter supposition, and is of less
    density than the globe, the ocean will not adjust itself uniformly
    around the centre of gravity; but the deviation from perfect uniformity
    is so trifling, as will be seen from the appended note of Sir William
    Thomson, that for all practical purposes it may be entirely left out of
    account.</p>

  <p>In the <cite>Reader</cite> for January 13, 1866, I advanced an objection to the
    submergence theory on the grounds that the lowering of the ocean-level
    by the evaporation of the water to form the ice-cap, would exceed the
    submergence resulting from the displacement of the earth’s centre of
    gravity. But, after my letter had gone to press, I found that I had
    overlooked some important considerations which seem to prove that the
    objection had no real foundation. For during a glacial period, say
    on the northern hemisphere, the entire mass of ice which presently
    exists on the southern hemisphere would be transferred to the northern,
    leaving the quantity of liquid water to a great extent unchanged.</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Note on the preceding by Sir William Thomson, F.R.S.</i></div>

  <p>“Mr. Croll’s estimate of the influence of a cap of ice on the sea-level
    is very remarkable in its relation to Laplace’s celebrated analysis,
    as being founded on that law of thickness which leads to expressions
    involving only the first term of the series of ‘Laplace’s functions,’
    or ‘spherical harmonics.’ The equation of the level surface, as
    altered by any given transference of solid matter, is expressed by
    equating the altered potential function to a constant. This function,
    when expanded in the series of spherical harmonics, has for its first
    term the potential due to the whole mass supposed collected at its
    altered centre of gravity. Hence a spherical surface round the altered
    centre of gravity is the <em>first</em> approximation in Laplace’s method of
    solution for the altered level surface. Mr. Croll has with admirable
    tact chosen, of all the arbitrary suppositions that may be made
    foundations for rough estimates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span> of the change of sea-level due to
    variations in the polar ice-crusts, <em>the</em> one which reduces to zero all
    terms after the first in the harmonic series, and renders that first
    approximation (which always expresses the <em>essence</em> of the result) the
    whole solution, undisturbed by terms irrelevant to the great physical
    question.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Croll, in the preceding paper, has alluded with remarkable
    clearness to the effect of the change in the distribution of the
    water in increasing, by its own attraction, the deviation of the
    level surface above that which is due to the <em>given</em> change in the
    distribution of solid matter. The remark he makes, that it is round
    the centre of gravity of the altered solid and altered liquid that
    the altering liquid surface adjusts itself, expresses the essence of
    Laplace’s celebrated demonstration of the stability of the ocean, and
    suggests the proper elementary solution of the problem to find the
    true alteration of sea-level produced by a given alteration of the
    solid. As an assumption leading to a simple calculation, let us suppose
    the solid earth to rise out of the water in a vast number of small
    flat-topped islands, each bounded by a perpendicular cliff, and let the
    proportion of water area to the whole be equal in all quarters. Let all
    of these islands in one hemisphere be covered with ice, of thickness
    according to the law assumed by Mr. Croll—that is, varying in simple
    proportion of the sine of the latitude. Let this ice be removed from
    the first hemisphere and similarly distributed over the islands of
    the second. By working out according to Mr. Croll’s directions, it is
    easily found that the change of sea-level which this will produce will
    consist in a sinking in the first hemisphere and rising in the second,
    through heights varying according to the same law (that is, simple
    proportionality to sines of latitudes), and amounting at each pole to</p>

  <p>“I shall now proceed to consider roughly what is the probable
    extent of submergence which, during the glacial epoch, may have
    resulted from the displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity
    by means of the transferrence of the polar ice from the one
    hemisphere to the other.”</p>

  <p><em>Difference between Continental-ice and a Glacier.</em>—An ordinary
    glacier descends in virtue of the slope of its bed, and, as a general
    rule, it is on this account thin at its commencement, and thickens
    as it descends into the lower valleys, where the slope is less and
    the resistance to motion greater. But in the case of continental ice
    matters are entirely different. The slope of the ground exercises
    little or no influence on the motion of the ice. In a continent of one
    or two thousand miles across, the general slope of the ground may be
    left out of account; for any slight elevation which the centre of such
    a continent may have will not compensate for the resistance offered to
    the flow of the ice by mountain ridges, hills, and other irregularities
    of its surface. The ice can move off such a surface only in consequence
    of pressure acting from the interior. In order to produce such a
    pressure, there must be a piling up of the ice in the interior; or, in
    other words, the ice-sheet must thicken from the edge inwards to the
    centre. We are necessarily led to the same conclusion, though we should
    not admit that the ice moves in consequence of pressure from behind,
    but should hold, on the contrary, that each particle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span> ice moves by
    gravity in virtue of its own weight; for in order to have such a motion
    there must be a slope, and as the slope is not on the ground, it must
    be on the ice itself: consequently we must conclude that the upper
    surface of the ice slopes upwards from the edge to the interior. What,
    then, is the least slope at which the ice will descend? Mr. Hopkins
    found that ice barely moves on a slope of one degree. We have therefore
    some data for arriving at least at a rough estimate of the probable
    thickness of an ice-sheet covering a continent, such, for example, as
    Greenland or the Antarctic Continent.</p>

  <p><em>Probable Thickness of the Antarctic Ice-cap.</em>—The antarctic continent
    is generally believed to extend, on an average, from the South Pole
    down to about, at least, lat. 70°. In round numbers, we may take the
    diameter of this continent at 2,800 miles. The distance from the
    edge of this ice-cap to its centre, the South Pole, will, therefore,
    be 1,400 miles. The whole of this continent, like Greenland, is
    undoubtedly covered with one continuous sheet of ice gradually
    thickening inwards from its edge to its centre. A slope of one degree
    continued for 1,400 miles will give twenty-four miles as the thickness
    of the ice at the pole. But suppose the slope of the upper surface
    of the cap to be only one-half this amount, viz., a half degree,—and
    we have no evidence that a slope so small would be sufficient to
    discharge the ice,—still we have twelve miles as the thickness of the
    cap at the pole. To those who have not been accustomed to reflect on
    the physical conditions of the problem, this estimate may doubtless
    be regarded as somewhat extravagant; but a slight consideration
    will show that it would be even more extravagant to assume that a
    slope of less than half a degree would be sufficient to produce the
    necessary outflow of the ice. In estimating the thickness of a sheet of
    continental ice of one or two thousand miles across, our imagination
    is apt to deceive us. We can easily form a pretty accurate sensuous
    representation of the thickness of the sheet; but we can form no
    adequate representation of its superficial area. We can represent
    to the mind with tolerable accuracy a thickness of a few miles, but
    we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span> cannot do this in reference to the area of a surface 2,800 miles
    across. Consequently, in judging what proportion the thickness of the
    sheet should bear to its superficial area, we are apt to fall into the
    error of under-estimating the thickness. We have a striking example
    of this in regard to the ocean. The thing which impresses us most
    forcibly in regard to the ocean is its profound depth. A mean depth
    of, say, three miles produces a striking impression; but if we could
    represent to the mind the vast area of the ocean as correctly as we can
    do its depth, <em>shallowness</em> rather than <em>depth</em> would be the impression
    produced. A sheet of water 100 yards in diameter, and only one inch
    deep, would not be called a <em>deep</em> but a very <em>shallow</em> pool or thin
    layer of water. But such a layer would be a correct representation of
    the ocean in miniature. Were we in like manner to represent to the eye
    in miniature the antarctic ice-cap, we would call it a <em>thin crust of
    ice</em>. Taking the mean thickness of the ice at four miles, the antarctic
    ice-sheet would be represented by a carpet covering the floor of an
    ordinary-sized dining-room. Were those who consider the above estimate
    of the thickness of the antarctic ice-cap as extravagantly great called
    upon to sketch on paper a section of what they should deem a cap of
    moderate thickness, ninety-nine out of every hundred would draw one of
    much greater thickness than twelve miles at the centre.</p>

  <p>The diagram on following page (Fig. 7) represents a section across the
    cap drawn to a natural scale; the upper surface of the sheet having
    a slope of half a degree. No one on looking at the section would
    pronounce it to be too thick at the centre, unless he were previously
    made aware that it represented a thickness of twelve miles at that
    place. It may be here mentioned that had the section been drawn upon
    a much larger scale—had it, for instance, been made seven feet long,
    instead of seven inches—it would have shown to the eye in a more
    striking manner the thinness of the cap.</p>

  <p>But to avoid all objections on the score of over-estimating the
    thickness of the cap, I shall assume the angle of the upper
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> surface to
    be only a quarter of a degree, and the thickness of the sheet one-half
    what it is represented in the section. The thickness at the pole will
    then be only six miles instead of twelve, and the mean thickness of the
    cap two instead of four miles.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Is there any well-grounded reason for concluding the above to be an
    over-estimate of the actual thickness of the antarctic ice? It is not
    so much in consequence of any <i lang="la">à priori</i> reason that can be urged
    against the probability of such a thickness of ice, but rather because
    it so far transcends our previous experience that we are reluctant to
    admit such an estimate. If we never had any experience of ice thicker
    than what is found in England, we should feel startled on learning for
    the first time that in the valleys of Switzerland the ice lay from 200
    to 300 feet in depth. Again, if we had never heard of glaciers thicker
    than those of Switzerland, we could hardly credit the statement that
    in Greenland they are actually from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick. We, in
    this country, have long been familiar with Greenland; but till very
    lately no one ever entertained the idea that that continent was buried
    under one continuous mass of ice, with scarcely a mountain top rising
    above the icy mantle. And had it not been that the geological phenomena
    of the glacial epoch have for so many years accustomed our minds to
    such an extraordinary condition of things, Dr. Rink’s description of
    the Greenland ice would probably have been regarded as the extravagant
    picture of a wild imagination.</p>

  <p>Let us now consider whether or not the facts of observation and
    experience, so far as they go,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span> bear out the conclusions to which
    physical considerations lead us in reference to the magnitude of
    continental ice; and more especially as regards the ice of the
    antarctic regions.</p>

  <p><em>First.</em> In so far as the antarctic ice-sheet is concerned, observation
    and experience to a great extent may be said to be a perfect blank. One
    or two voyagers have seen the outer edge of the sheet at a few places,
    and this is all. In fact, we judge of the present condition of the
    interior of the antarctic continent in a great measure from what we
    know of Greenland. But again, our experience of Greenland ice is almost
    wholly confined to the outskirts.</p>

  <p>Few have penetrated into the interior, and, with the exception of Dr.
    Hayes and Professor Nordenskjöld, none, as far as I know, have passed
    to any considerable distance over the inland ice. Dr. Robert Brown
    in his interesting memoir on “Das Innere von Grönland,”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> gives
    an account of an excursion made in 1747 by a Danish officer of the
    name of Dalager, from Fredrikshaab, near the southern extremity of
    the continent, into the interior. After a journey of a day or two, he
    reached an eminence from which he saw the inland ice stretching in an
    unbroken mass as far as the eye could reach, but was unable to proceed
    further. Dr. Brown gives an account also of an excursion made in the
    beginning of March, 1830, by O. B. Kielsen, a Danish whale-fisher, from
    Holsteinborg (lat. 67° N.). After a most fatiguing journey of several
    days, he reached a high point from which he could see the ice of the
    interior. Next morning he got up early, and towards midday reached
    an extensive plain. From this the land sank inwards, and Kielsen now
    saw fully in view before him the enormous ice-sheet of the interior.
    He drove rapidly over all the little hills, lakes, and streams, till
    he reached a pretty large lake at the edge of the ice-sheet. This was
    the end of his journey, for after vainly attempting to climb up on the
    ice-sheet, he was compelled to retrace his steps, and had a somewhat
    difficult return. When he arrived at the fiord, he found the ice broken
    up, so that he had to go round <span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>by the land way, by which he reached
    the depôt on the 9th of March. The distance which he traversed in a
    straight line from Holsteinborg into the interior measured eighty
    English miles.</p>

  <p>Dr. Hayes’s excursion was made, however, not upon the real inland
    ice, but upon a smaller ice-field connected with it; while Professor
    Nordenskjöld’s excursion was made at a place too far south to
    afford an accurate idea of the actual condition of the interior of
    North Greenland, even though he had penetrated much farther than he
    actually did. However, the state of things as recorded by Hayes and by
    Nordenskjöld affords us a glimpse into the condition of things in the
    interior of the continent. They both found by observation, what follows
    as a necessary result from physical considerations, that the upper
    surface of the ice plain, under which hills and valleys are buried,
    gradually <em>slopes upwards towards the interior of the continent</em>.
    Professor Nordenskjöld states that when at the extreme point at which
    he reached, thirty geographical miles from the coast, he had attained
    an elevation of 2,200 feet, and that the inland ice <em>continued
    constantly to rise</em> towards the interior, so that the horizon towards
    the east, north, and south, was terminated by an ice-border almost as
    smooth as that of the ocean.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Hayes and his party penetrated inwards to the distance of about
    seventy miles. On the first day they reached the foot of the great Mer
    de Glace; the second day’s journey carried them to the upper surface
    of the ice-sheet. On the third day they travelled 30 miles, and the
    ascent, which had been about 6°, diminished gradually to about 2°. They
    advanced on the fourth day about 25 miles; the temperature being 30°
    below zero (Fah.). “Our station at the camp,” he says, “was sublime as
    it was dangerous. We had attained an altitude of 5,000 feet above the
    sea-level, and were 70 miles from the coast, in the midst of a vast
    frozen Sahara immeasurable to the human eye. There was neither hill,
    mountain, nor gorge, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>anywhere in view. We had completely sunk the
    strip of land between the Mer de Glace and the sea, and no object met
    the eye but our feeble tent, which bent to the storm. Fitful clouds
    swept over the face of the full-orbed moon, which, descending towards
    the horizon, glimmered through the drifting snow that scudded over the
    icy plain—to the eye in undulating lines of downy softness, to the
    flesh in showers of piercing darts.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Rink, referring to the inland ice, says that the elevation or
    height above the sea of this icy plain at its junction with the
    outskirts of the country, and where it begins to lower itself through
    the valleys to the firths, is, in the ramifications of the Bay of
    Omenak, found to be 2,000 feet, from which level <em>it gradually rises
    towards the interior</em>.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Robert Brown, who, along with Mr. Whymper in 1867, attempted a
    journey to some distance over the inland ice, is of opinion that
    Greenland is not traversed by any ranges of mountains or high land,
    but that the entire continent, 1,200 miles in length and 400 miles in
    breadth, is covered with one continuous unbroken field of ice, the
    upper surface of which, he says, <em>rises by a gentle slope towards the
    interior</em>.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

  <p>Suppose now the point reached by Hayes to be within 200 miles of
    the centre of dispersion of the ice, and the mean slope from that
    point to the centre, as in the case of the antarctic cap, to be only
    half a degree; this would give 10,000 feet as the elevation of the
    centre above the point reached. But the point reached was 5,000 feet
    above sea-level, consequently the surface of the ice at the centre
    of dispersion would be 15,000 feet above sea-level, which is about
    one-fourth what I have concluded to be the elevation of the surface
    of the antarctic ice-cap at its centre. And supposing we assume
    the general surface of the ground to have in the central region an
    elevation as great as 5,000 feet, which is not at all probable, still
    this would give 10,000 feet for the thickness of the ice at the centre
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>of the Greenland continent. But if we admit this conclusion in
    reference to the thickness of the Greenland ice, we must admit that
    the antarctic ice is far thicker, because the thickness, other things
    being equal, will depend upon the size, or, more properly, upon the
    diameter of the continent; for the larger the surface the greater is
    the thickness of ice required to produce the pressure requisite to make
    the rate of discharge of the ice equal to the rate of increase. Now
    the area of the antarctic continent must be at least a dozen of times
    greater than that of Greenland.</p>

  <p><em>Second.</em> That the antarctic ice must be far thicker than the arctic
    is further evident from the dimensions of the icebergs which have been
    met with in the Southern Ocean. No icebergs over three hundred feet in
    height have been found in the arctic regions, whereas in the antarctic
    regions, as we shall see, icebergs of twice and even thrice that height
    have been reported.</p>

  <p><em>Third.</em> We have no reason to believe that the thickness of the ice
    at present covering the antarctic continent is less than that which
    covered a continent of a similar area in temperate regions during the
    glacial epoch. Take, for example, the North American continent, or,
    more properly, that portion of it covered by ice during the glacial
    epoch. Professor Dana has proved that during that period the thickness
    of the ice on the American continent must in many places have been
    considerably over a mile. He has shown that over the northern border of
    New England the ice had a mean thickness of 6,500 feet, while its mean
    thickness over the Canada watershed, between St. Lawrence and Hudson’s
    Bay, was not less than 12,000 feet, or upwards of two miles and a
    quarter (see <cite>American Journal of Science and Art</cite> for March, 1873).</p>

  <p><em>Fourth.</em> Some may object to the foregoing estimate of the amount of
    ice on the antarctic continent, on the grounds that the quantity of
    snowfall in that region cannot be much. But it must be borne in mind
    that, no matter however small the annual amount of snowfall may be, if
    more falls than is melted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> the ice must continue to accumulate year by
    year till its thickness in the centre of the continent be sufficiently
    great to produce motion. The opinion that the snowfall of the antarctic
    regions is not great does not, however, appear to be borne out by the
    observation and experience of those who have visited those regions.
    Captain Wilkes, of the American Exploring Expedition, estimated it at
    30 feet per annum; and Sir James Ross says, that during a whole month
    they had only three days free from snow. The fact that perpetual snow
    is found at the sea-level at lat. 64° S. proves that the snowfall
    must be great. But there is another circumstance which must be taken
    into account, viz., that the currents carrying moisture move in from
    all directions towards the pole, consequently the area on which they
    deposit their snow becomes less and less as the pole is reached, and
    this must, to a corresponding extent, increase the quantity of snow
    falling on a given area. Let us assume, for example, that the clouds
    in passing from lat. 60° to lat. 80° deposit moisture sufficient to
    produce, say, 30 feet of snow per annum, and that by the time they
    reach lat. 80° they are in possession of only one-tenth part of their
    original store of moisture. As the area between lat. 80° and the
    pole is but one-eighth of that between lat. 60° and 80°, this would,
    notwithstanding, give 24 feet as the annual amount of snowfall between
    lat. 80° and the pole.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

  <p><em>Fifth.</em> The enormous size and thickness of the icebergs which have
    been met with in the Southern Ocean testify to the thickness of the
    antarctic ice-cap.</p>

  <p>We know from the size of some of the icebergs which have been met with
    in the southern hemisphere that the ice at the edge of the cap where
    the bergs break off must in some cases be considerably over a mile in
    thickness, for icebergs of more <span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>than a mile in thickness have been
    found in the southern hemisphere. The following are the dimensions of
    a few of these enormous bergs taken from the Twelfth Number of the
    Meteorological Papers published by the Board of Trade, and from the
    excellent paper of Mr. Towson on the Icebergs of the Southern Ocean,
    published also by the Board of Trade.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> With one or two exceptions,
    the heights of the bergs were accurately determined by angular
    measurement:—</p>

  <p class="hang">Sept. 10th, 1856.—The <em>Lightning</em>, when in lat. 55° 33′ S.,
    long. 140° W., met with an iceberg 420 feet high.</p>

    this iceberg resemble land, that Captain Smithers believed it
    to be an island, and reported it as such, but there is little
    or no doubt that it was in reality an iceberg. There were
    pieces of drift-ice under its lee.</p>

    lat. 52° 31′ S., long. 43° 43′ W., two large icebergs, one at
    least 800 feet high.
  </p>

  <p class="p2">Mr. Towson states that one of our most celebrated and talented
    naval surveyors informed him that he had seen icebergs in the
    southern regions 800 feet high.</p>

  <p class="hang">March 23rd, 1855.—The <cite>Agneta</cite> passed an iceberg in lat. 53° 14′ S.,
    long. 14° 41′ E., 960 feet in height.</p>

  <p class="hang">Aug. 16th, 1840.—The Dutch ship, <cite>General Baron von Geen</cite>, passed an
    iceberg 1,000 feet high in lat. 37° 32′ S., long. 14° 10′ E.</p>

  <p class="hang">May 15th, 1859.—The <cite>Roseworth</cite> found in lat. 53° 40′ S., long. 123°
    17′ W., an iceberg as large as “Tristan d’Acunha.”</p>

  <p>In the regions where most of these icebergs were met with, the mean
    density of the sea is about 1·0256. The density of ice is ·92. The
    density of icebergs to that of the sea is therefore as 1 to 1·115;
    consequently every foot of ice above water indicates 8·7 feet below
    water. It therefore follows that those icebergs 400 feet high had 3,480
    feet under water,—3,880 feet would consequently be the total thickness
    of the ice. The icebergs which were 500 feet high would be 4,850 feet
    thick, those 600 feet high would have a total thickness of 5,820 feet,
    and those 700 feet high would be no less than 6,790 feet thick, which
    is more than a mile and a quarter. The iceberg 960 feet high, sighted
    by the <cite>Agneta</cite>, would be actually 9,312 feet thick, which is upwards
    of a mile and three-quarters.</p>

  <p>Although the mass of an iceberg below water compared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span> that above
    may be taken to be about 8·7 to 1, yet it would not be always safe
    to conclude that the thickness of the ice below water bears the same
    proportion to its height above. If the berg, for example, be much
    broader at its base than at its top, the thickness of the ice below
    water would bear a less proportion to the height above water than
    as 8·7 to 1. But a berg such as that recorded by Captain Clark, 500
    feet high and three miles long, must have had only 1/8·7 of its total
    thickness above water. The same remark applies also to the one seen by
    Captain Smithers, which was 580 feet high, and so large that it was
    taken for an island. This berg must have been 5,628 feet in thickness.
    The enormous berg which came in collision with the <cite>Royal Standard</cite>
    must have been 5,820 feet thick. It is not stated what length the
    icebergs 730, 960, and 1,000 feet high respectively were; but supposing
    that we make considerable allowance for the possibility that the
    proportionate thickness of ice below water to that above may have been
    less than as 8·7 to 1, still we can hardly avoid the conclusion that
    the icebergs were considerably above a mile in thickness. But if there
    are icebergs above a mile in thickness, then there must be land-ice
    somewhere on the southern hemisphere of that thickness. In short, the
    great antarctic ice-cap must in some places be over a mile in thickness
    at its edge.</p>

  <p><em>Inadequate Conceptions regarding the Magnitude of Continental
    Ice.</em>—Few things have tended more to mislead geologists in the
    interpretation of glacial phenomena than inadequate conceptions
    regarding the magnitude of continental ice. Without the conception
    of continental ice the known facts connected with glaciation would
    be perfectly inexplicable. It was only when it was found that the
    accumulated facts refused to be explained by any other conception,
    that belief in the very existence of such a thing as continental ice
    became common. But although most geologists now admit the existence of
    continental ice, yet, nevertheless, adequate conceptions of its real
    magnitude are by no means so common. Year by year, as the outstanding
    facts connected with glaciation accumulate, we are compelled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span> extend
    our conceptions of the magnitude of land-ice. Take the following as
    an example. It was found that the transport of the Wastdale Crag
    blocks, the direction of the striæ on the islands of the Baltic, on
    Caithness and on the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe, islands, the boulder
    clay with broken shells in Caithness, Holderness, and other places,
    were inexplicable on the theory of land-ice. But it was so only in
    consequence of the inadequacy of our conceptions of the magnitude of
    the ice; for a slight extension of our ideas of its thickness has
    explained not only these phenomena,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> but others of an equally
    remarkable character, such as the striation of the Long Island and
    the submerged rock-basins around our coasts described by Mr. James
    Geikie. In like manner, if we admit the theory of the glacial epoch
    propounded in former chapters, all that is really necessary to account
    for the submergence of the land is a slight extension of our hitherto
    preconceived estimate of the thickness of the ice on the antarctic
    continent. If we simply admit a conclusion to which all physical
    considerations, as we have seen, necessarily lead us, viz., that the
    antarctic continent is covered with a mantle of ice at least two miles
    in thickness, we have then a complete explanation of the cause of the
    submergence of the land during the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>Although of no great importance to the question under consideration, it
    may be remarked that, except during the severest part of the glacial
    epoch, we have no reason to believe that the total quantity of ice
    on the globe was much greater than at present, only it would then be
    all on one hemisphere. Remove two miles of ice from the antarctic
    continent, and place it on the northern hemisphere, and this, along
    with the ice that now exists on this hemisphere, would equal, in all
    probability, the quantity existing on our hemisphere during the glacial
    epoch; at least, before it reached its maximum severity.</p>

  <p><em>Extent of Submergence from Displacement of Earth’s Centre of
    Gravity.</em>—How much, then, would the transference of the two miles of
    ice from the southern to the northern hemisphere raise the level of the
    ocean on the latter hemisphere? This mass, be it observed, is equal to
    only one-half that represented in our section. A considerable amount
    of discussion has arisen in regard to the method of determining this
    point. According to the method already detailed, which supposes the
    rise at the pole to be equal to the extent of the displacement of the
    earth’s centre of gravity, the rise at the North Pole would be about
    380 feet, taking into account the effect produced by the displaced
    water; and the rise in the latitude of Edinburgh would be 312 feet. The
    fall of level on the southern hemisphere would, of course, be equal to
    the rise of level on the northern. According to the method advanced
    by Mr. D. D. Heath,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the rise of level at the North Pole would be
    about 650 feet. Archdeacon Pratt’s method<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> makes the rise still
    greater; while according to Rev. O. Fisher’s method<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> the rise would
    be no <span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>less than 2,000 feet. There is, however, another circumstance
    which must be taken into account, which will give an additional rise of
    upwards of one hundred feet.</p>

  <p>The greatest extent of the displacement of the earth’s centre of
    gravity, and consequently the greatest rise of the ocean resulting
    from that displacement, would of course occur at the time of maximum
    glaciation, when the ice was all on one hemisphere. But owing to the
    following circumstance, a still greater rise than that resulting from
    the displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity alone might take
    place at some considerable time, either before or after the period of
    maximum glaciation.</p>

  <p>It is not at all probable that the ice would melt on the warm
    hemisphere at exactly the same rate as it would form on the cold
    hemisphere. It is probable that the ice would melt more rapidly on the
    warm hemisphere than it would form on the cold. Suppose that during
    the glacial epoch, at a time when the cold was gradually increasing on
    the northern and the warmth on the southern hemisphere, the ice should
    melt more rapidly off the antarctic continent than it was being formed
    on the arctic and subarctic regions; suppose also that, by the time
    a quantity of ice, equal to one-half what exists at present on the
    antarctic continent, had accumulated on the northern hemisphere, the
    whole of the antarctic ice had been melted away, the sea would then be
    fuller than at present by the amount of water resulting from the one
    mile of melted ice. The height to which this would raise the general
    level of the sea would be as follows:—</p>

  <p>The antarctic ice-cap is equal in area to 1/23·46 of that covered by
    the ocean. The density of ice to that of water being taken at ·92 to
    1, it follows that 25 feet 6 inches of ice melted off the cap would
    raise the general level of the ocean one foot, and the one mile of
    ice melted off would raise the level 200 feet. This 200 feet of rise
    resulting from the melted ice we must add to the rise resulting from
    the displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity. The removal of the
    two miles of ice from the antarctic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> continent would displace the
    centre of gravity 190 feet, and the formation of a mass of ice equal
    to the one-half of this on the arctic regions would carry the centre
    of gravity 95 feet farther; giving in all a total displacement of 285
    feet, thus producing a rise of sea-level at the North Pole of 285 feet,
    and in the latitude of Edinburgh of 234 feet. Add to this the rise of
    200 feet resulting from the melted ice, and we have then 485 feet of
    submergence at the pole, and 434 feet in the latitude of Edinburgh. A
    rise to a similar extent might probably take place after the period
    of maximum glaciation, when the ice would be melting on the northern
    hemisphere more rapidly than it would be forming on the southern.</p>

  <p>If we assume the antarctic ice-cap to be as thick as is represented in
    the diagram, the extent of the submergence would of course be double
    the above, and we might have in this case a rise of sea-level in the
    latitude of Edinburgh to the extent of from 800 to 1,000 feet. But be
    this as it may, it is evident that the quantity of ice on the antarctic
    continent is perfectly sufficient to account for the submergence of
    the glacial epoch, for we have little evidence to conclude that the
    <em>general</em> submergence much exceeded 400 or 500 feet.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> We have
    evidence in England and other places of submergence to the extent of
    from 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but these may be quite local, resulting
    from subsidence of the land in those particular areas. Elevations and
    depressions of the land have taken place in all ages, and no doubt
    during the glacial epoch also.</p>

  <p><em>Circumstances which show that the Glacial Submergence resulted from
    Displacement of the Earth’s Centre of Gravity.</em>—In favour of this
    view of the cause of the submergence of the glacial epoch, it is a
    circumstance of some significance, that in every part of the globe
    where glaciation has been found evidence of the submergence of the
    land has also been found along with it. The invariable occurrence of
    submergence along with glaciation <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>points to some physical connection
    between the two. It would seem to imply, either that the two were the
    direct effects of a common cause, or that the one was the cause of the
    other; that is, the submergence the cause of the glaciation, or the
    glaciation the cause of the submergence. There is, I presume, no known
    cause to which the two can be directly related as effects. Nor do I
    think that there is any one who would suppose that the submergence of
    the land could have been the cause of its glaciation, even although he
    attributed all glacial effects to floating ice. The submergence of our
    country would, of course, have allowed floating ice to pass over it had
    there been any to pass over; but submergence would not have produced
    the ice, neither would it have brought the ice from the arctic regions
    where it already existed. But although submergence could not have been
    the cause of the glacial epoch, yet we can, as we have just seen,
    easily understand how the ice of the glacial epoch could have been the
    cause of the submergence. If the glacial epoch was brought about by an
    increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, then a submergence
    of the land as the ice accumulated was a physical necessity.</p>

  <p>There is another circumstance connected with glacial submergence which
    it is difficult to reconcile with the idea that it resulted from a
    subsidence of the land. It is well known that during the glacial
    epoch the land was not once under water only, but several times; and,
    besides, there were not merely several periods when the land stood
    at a lower level in relation to the sea than at present, but there
    were also several periods when it stood at a much higher level than
    now. And this holds true, not merely of our own country, but of every
    country on the northern hemisphere where glaciation has yet been found.
    All this follows as a necessary consequence from the theory that the
    oscillations of sea-level resulted from the transference of the ice
    from the one hemisphere to the other; but it is wholly inconsistent
    with the idea that they resulted from upheavals and subsidence of the
    land during a very recent period.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

  <p>But this is not all, there is more still to be accounted for. It has
    been the prevailing opinion that at the time when the land was covered
    with ice, it stood at a much greater elevation than at present. It
    is, however, not maintained that the facts of geology establish such
    a conclusion. The greater elevation of the land is simply assumed as
    an hypothesis to account for the cold.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The facts of geology,
    however, are fast establishing the opposite conclusion, viz., that
    when the country was covered with ice, the land stood in relation to
    the sea at a lower level than at present, and that the continental
    periods or times when the land stood in relation to the sea at a higher
    level than now were the warm inter-glacial periods, when the country
    was free of snow and ice, and a mild and equable condition of climate
    prevailed. This is the conclusion towards which we are being led by the
    more recent revelations of surface geology, and also by certain facts
    connected with the geographical distribution of plants and animals
    during the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>The simple occurrence of a rise and fall of the land in relation to
    the sea-level in one or in two countries during the glacial epoch,
    would not necessarily imply any physical connection. The coincidence
    of these movements with the glaciation of the land might have been
    purely accidental; but when we find that a succession of such movements
    occurred, not merely in one or in two countries, but in every glaciated
    country where proper observations have been made, we are forced to the
    conclusion that the connection between the two is not accidental, but
    the result of some fixed cause.</p>

  <p>If we admit that an increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit
    was the cause of the glacial epoch, then we must admit that all those
    results followed as necessary consequences. For if the glacial epoch
    lasted for upwards of one hundred thousand years or so, there would be
    a succession of cold and warm periods, and consequently a succession
    of elevations and depressions of sea-level. And the elevations of
    the sea-level would <span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>take place during the cold periods, and the
    depressions during the warm periods.</p>

  <p>But the agreement between theory and observed facts does not terminate
    here. It follows from theory that the greatest oscillations of
    sea-level would take place during the severest part of the glacial
    epoch, when the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit would be at its
    highest value, and that the oscillations would gradually diminish
    in extent as the eccentricity diminished and the climate gradually
    became less severe. Now it is well known that this is actually what
    took place; the great submergence, as well as the great elevation or
    continental period, occurred during the earlier or more severe part of
    the glacial epoch, and as the climate grew less severe these changes
    became of less extent, till we find them terminating in our submerged
    forests and 25-foot raised beach.</p>

  <p>It follows, therefore, according to the theory advanced, that the mere
    fact of an area having been under sea does not imply that there has
    been any subsidence or elevation of the land, and that consequently the
    inference which has been drawn from these submerged areas as to changes
    in physical geography may be in many cases not well founded.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Lyell, in his “Principles,” publishes a map showing the
    extent of surface in Europe which has been covered by the sea since
    the earlier part of the Tertiary period. This map is intended to show
    the extraordinary amount of subsidence and elevation of the land which
    has taken place during that period. It is necessary for Sir Charles’s
    theory of the cause of the glacial epoch that changes in the physical
    geography of the globe to an enormous extent should have taken place
    during a very recent period, in order to account for the great change
    of climate which occurred at that epoch. But if the foregoing results
    be anything like correct, it does not necessarily follow that there
    must have been great changes in the physical geography of Europe,
    simply because the sea covered those areas marked in the map, for this
    may have been produced by oscillations of sea-level, and not by changes
    in the land. In fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span> the areas marked in Sir Charles’s map as having
    been covered by the sea, are just those which would be covered were the
    sea-level raised a few hundred feet. No doubt there were elevations and
    subsidences in many of the areas marked in the map during the Tertiary
    period, and to this cause a considerable amount of the submergence
    might be due; but I have little doubt that by far the greater part
    must be attributed to oscillations of sea-level. It is no objection
    that the greater part of the shells and other organic remains found
    in the marine deposits of those areas are not indicative of a cold
    or glacial condition of climate, for, as we have seen, the greatest
    submergence would probably have taken place either before the more
    severe cold had set in or after it had to a great extent passed away.
    That the submergence of those areas probably resulted from elevations
    of sea-level rather than depressions of the land, is further evident
    from the following considerations. If we suppose that the climate of
    the glacial epoch was brought about mainly by changes in the physical
    geography of the globe, we must assume that these great changes took
    place, geologically speaking, at a very recent date. Then when we ask
    what ground is there for assuming that any such change in the relations
    of sea and land as is required actually took place, the submergence
    of those areas is adduced as the proof. Did it follow as a physical
    necessity that all submergence must be the result of subsidence of the
    land, and not of elevations of the sea, there would be some force in
    the reasons adduced. But such a conclusion by no means follows, and,
    <i lang="la">à priori</i>, it is just as likely that the appearance of the ice was
    the cause of the submergence as that the submergence was the cause
    of the appearance of the ice. Again, a subsidence of the land to the
    extent required would to a great extent have altered the configuration
    of the country, and the main river systems of Europe; but there is no
    evidence that any such change has taken place. All the main valleys
    are well known to have existed prior to the glacial epoch, and our
    rivers to have occupied the same channels then as they do now. In the
    case of some of the smaller streams, it is true, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> slight deviation
    has resulted at some points from the filling up of their channels with
    drift during the glacial epoch; but as a general rule all the principal
    valleys and river systems are older than the glacial epoch. This, of
    course, could not be the case if a subsidence of the land sufficiently
    great to account for the submergence of the areas in question, or
    changes in the physical geography of Europe necessary to produce a
    glacial epoch, had actually taken place. The total absence of any
    geological evidence for the existence of any change which could explain
    either the submergence of the areas in question or the climate of the
    glacial epoch, is strong evidence that the submergence of the glacial
    epoch, as well as of the areas in question, was the result of a simple
    oscillation of sea-level resulting from the displacement of the earth’s
    centre of gravity by the transferrence of the ice-cap from the southern
    to the northern hemisphere.</p>

  <p><em>Oscillations of Sea-level in relation to Distribution.</em>—The
    oscillations of sea-level resulting from the displacement of the
    earth’s centre of gravity help to throw new light on some obscure
    points connected with the subject of the geographical distribution
    of plants and animals. At the time when the ice was on the southern
    hemisphere during the glacial epoch, and the northern hemisphere was
    enjoying a warm and equable climate, the sea-level would be several
    hundred feet lower than at present, the North Sea would probably be
    dry land, and Great Britain and Ireland joined to the continent, thus
    opening up a pathway from the continent to our island. As has been
    shown in former chapters, during the inter-glacial periods the climate
    would be much warmer and more equable than now, so that animals from
    the south, such as the hippopotamus, hyæna, lion, <i>Elephas antiquus</i>
    and <i>Rhinoceros megarhinus</i>, would migrate into this country, where
    at present they could not live in consequence of the cold. We have
    therefore an explanation, as was suggested on a former occasion,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
    of the fact that the bones of these animals are found mingled in the
    same grave with those of the musk-ox, mammoth, reindeer, and other
    animals which lived in this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>country during the cold periods of the
    glacial epoch; the animals from the north would cross over into this
    country upon the frozen sea during the cold periods, while those from
    the south would find the English Channel dry land during the warm
    periods.</p>

  <p>The same reasoning will hold equally true in reference to the old
    and new world. The depth of Behring Straits is under 30 fathoms;
    consequently a lowering of the sea-level of less than 200 feet would
    connect Asia with America, and thus allow plants and animals, as Mr.
    Darwin believes, to pass from the one continent to the other.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
    During this period, when Behring Straits would be dry land, Greenland
    would be comparatively free from ice, and the arctic regions enjoying a
    comparatively mild climate. In this case plants and animals belonging
    to temperate regions could avail themselves of this passage, and thus
    we can explain how plants belonging to temperate regions may have,
    during the Miocene period, passed from the old to the new continent,
    and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p>As has already been noticed, during the time of the greatest extension
    of the ice, the quantity of ice on the southern hemisphere might be
    considerably greater than what exists on the entire globe at present.
    In that case there might, in addition to the lowering of the sea-level
    resulting from the displacement of the earth’s centre of gravity, be a
    considerable lowering resulting from the draining of the ocean to form
    the additional ice. This decrease and increase in the total quantity
    of ice which we have considered would affect the level of the ocean as
    much at the equator as at the poles; consequently during the glacial
    epoch there might have been at the equator elevations and depressions
    of sea-level to the extent of a few hundred feet.</p>

  <p><em>Extent of Submergence on the Hypothesis that the Earth is fluid in
    the Interior.</em>—But we have been proceeding upon the supposition that
    the earth is solid to its centre. If we assume, however, what is the
    general opinion among geologists, that it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>consists of a fluid interior
    surrounded by a thick and rigid crust or shell, then the extent of the
    submergence resulting from the displacement of the centre of gravity
    for a given thickness of ice must be much greater than I have estimated
    it to be. This is evident, because, if the interior of the globe be in
    a fluid state, it, in all probability, consists of materials differing
    in density. The densest materials will be at the centre, and the least
    dense at the outside or surface. Now the transferrence of an ice-cap
    from the one pole to the other will not merely displace the ocean—the
    fluid mass on the outside of the shell—but it will also displace the
    heavier fluid materials in the interior of the shell. In other words,
    the heavier materials will be attracted by the ice-cap more forcibly
    than the lighter, consequently they will approach towards the cap to a
    certain extent, sinking, as it were, into the lighter materials, and
    displacing them towards the opposite pole. This displacement will of
    course tend to shift the earth’s centre of gravity in the direction
    of the ice-cap, because the heavier materials are shifted in this
    direction, and the lighter materials in the opposite direction. This
    process will perhaps be better understood from the following figures.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

  <p>In Fig. 8, where there is no ice-cap, the centre of gravity of the
    earth coincides with the centre of the concentric layers of the fluid
    interior. In Fig. 9, where there is an ice-cap placed on one pole, the
    concentric layer F<sup>1</sup> being denser than layer F, is attracted towards
    the cap more forcibly than F, and consequently sinks to a certain depth
    in F. Again, F<sup>2</sup> being denser than F<sup>1</sup>, it also sinks to a certain
    extent in F<sup>1</sup>. And again F<sup>3</sup>, the mass at the centre, being denser than
    F<sup>2</sup>, it also sinks in F<sup>2</sup>. All this being combined with the effects
    of the ice-cap, and the displaced ocean outside the shell, the centre
    of gravity of the entire globe will no longer be at C, but at C<sup>1</sup>, a
    considerable distance nearer to the side of the shell on which the
    cap rests than C, and also a considerable distance nearer than it
    would have been had the interior of the globe been solid. There are
    here three causes tending to shift the centre of gravity, (1) the
    ice-cap, (2) the displaced ocean, and (3) the displaced materials in
    the interior. Two of the three causes mutually react on each other in
    such a way as to increase each other’s effect. Thus the more the ocean
    is drawn in the direction of the ice-cap, the more effect it has in
    drawing the heavier materials in the interior in the same direction;
    and in turn the more the heavier materials in the interior are drawn
    towards the cap, the greater is the displacement of the earth’s centre
    of gravity, and of course, as a consequence, the greater is the
    displacement of the ocean. It may be observed also that, other things
    being equal, the thinner the solid crust or shell is, and the greater
    the difference in the density of the fluid materials in the interior,
    the greater will be the extent of the displacement of the ocean,
    because the greater will be the displacement of the centre of gravity.</p>

  <p>It follows that if we knew (1) the extent of the general submergence of
    the glacial epoch, and (2) the present amount of ice on the southern
    hemisphere, we could determine whether or not the earth is fluid in the
    interior.</p>

    Stockwell on the maximum Change of Obliquity.—How Obliquity

  <p><em>The direct Effect of Change in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic on
    Climate.</em>—There is still another cause which, I feel convinced, must to
    a very considerable extent have affected climate during past geological
    ages. I refer to the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic. This
    cause has long engaged the attention of geologists and physicists,
    and the conclusion generally come to is that no great effect can be
    attributed to it. After giving special attention to the matter, I have
    been led to the very opposite conclusion. It is quite true, as has
    been urged, that the changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic cannot
    sensibly affect the climate of temperate regions; but it will produce
    a slight change on the climate of tropical latitudes, and a very
    considerable effect on that of the polar regions, especially at the
    poles themselves. We shall now consider the matter briefly.</p>

  <p>It was found by Laplace that the obliquity of the ecliptic will
    oscillate to the extent of 1° 22′ 34″ on each side of 23° 28′, the
    obliquity in the year 1801.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> This point has lately been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>examined
    by Mr. Stockwell, and the results at which he has arrived are almost
    identical with those of Laplace. “The mean value of the obliquity,” he
    says, “of both the apparent and fixed ecliptics to the equator is 23°
    17′ 17″. The limits of the obliquity of the apparent ecliptic to the
    equator are 24° 35′ 58″ and 21° 58′ 36″; whence it follows that the
    greatest and least declinations of the sun at the solstices can never
    differ from each other to any greater extent than 2° 37′ 22″.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

  <p>This change will but slightly affect the climate of the temperate
    regions, but it will exercise a very considerable influence on
    the climate of the polar regions. According to Mr. Meech,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> if
    365·24 thermal days represent the present total annual quantity of
    heat received at the equator from the sun, 151·59 thermal days will
    represent the quantity received at the poles. Adopting his method of
    calculation, it turns out that when the obliquity of the ecliptic is at
    the maximum assigned by Laplace the quantity received at the equator
    would be 363·51 thermal days, and at the poles 160·04 thermal days. The
    equator would therefore receive 1·73 thermal days less heat, and the
    poles 8·45 thermal days more heat than at present.</p>

  <p>When the obliquity was at a maximum, the poles would therefore be
    receiving 19 rays for every 18 they are receiving at present. The
    poles would then be receiving nearly as much heat as latitude 76° is
    receiving at present.</p>

  <p>The increase of obliquity would not sensibly affect the polar winter.
    It is true that it would slightly increase the breadth of the
    frigid zone, but the length of the winter at the poles would remain
    unaffected. After the sun disappears below the horizon his rays are
    completely cut off, so that a further descent of 1° 22′ 34″ would make
    no material difference in the climate. In the temperate regions, the
    sun’s altitude at the winter solstice would be 1° 22′ 34″ less than
    at present. This would slightly increase the cold of winter in those
    regions. But the increase in the amount of heat received by the polar
    regions would materially affect the condition of the polar summer.
    What, then, is the rise of temperature at the poles which would result
    from the increase of 8·45 thermal days in the total amount received
    from the sun?</p>

  <p>An increase of 8·45 thermal days, or 1/18th of the total quantity
    received from the sun, according to the mode of calculation adopted in
    Chap. II. would produce, all other things being equal, a rise in the
    mean annual temperature equal to 14° or 15°.</p>

  <p>According to Professor Dove<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> there is a difference of 7°·6
    between the mean annual temperature of latitude 76° and the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>pole;
    the temperature of the former being 9°·8, and that of the latter
    2°·2. Since it follows that when the obliquity of the ecliptic is
    at a maximum the poles would receive about as much heat per annum
    as latitude 76° receives at present, it may be supposed that the
    temperature of the poles at that period ought to be no higher than
    that of latitude 76° at the present time. A little consideration will,
    however, show that this by no means follows. Professor Dove’s Tables
    represent correctly the mean annual temperature corresponding to every
    tenth degree of latitude from the equator to the pole. But it must be
    observed that the rate at which the temperature diminishes from the
    equator to the pole is not proportionate to the decrease in the total
    quantity of heat received from the sun as we pass from the equator to
    the pole. Were the mean annual temperature of the various latitudes
    proportionate to the amount of direct heat received, the equator
    would be much warmer than it actually is at present, and the poles
    much colder. The reason of this, as has been shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>, is
    perfectly obvious. There is a constant transferrence of <em>heat</em> from
    the equator to the poles, and of <em>cold</em> from the poles to the equator.
    The warm water of the equator is constantly flowing towards the poles,
    and the cold water at the poles is constantly flowing to the equator.
    The same is the case in regard to the aërial currents. Consequently
    a great portion of the direct heat of the sun goes, not to raise the
    temperature of the equator, but to heat the poles. And, on the other
    hand, the cold materials at the poles are transferred to the equator,
    and thus lower the temperature of that part of the globe to a great
    extent. The present difference of temperature between lat. 76° and the
    pole, determined according to the rate at which the temperature is
    found to diminish between the equator and the pole, amounts to only
    about 7° or 8°. But were there no mutual transferrence of warm and
    cold materials between the equatorial and polar regions, and were the
    temperature of each latitude to depend solely upon the direct rays of
    the sun, the difference would far exceed that amount.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

  <p>Now, when the obliquity of the ecliptic was at its superior limit, and
    the poles receiving about 1/18th more direct heat from the sun than
    at present, the increase of temperature due to this increase of heat
    would be far more than 7° or 8. It would probably be nearly double that
    amount.</p>

  <p>“We may, therefore, conclude that when the obliquity of the ecliptic
    was at a maximum, and the poles were receiving 1/18th more heat than
    at present, the temperature of the poles ought to have been about 14°
    or 15° warmer than at the present day, <em>provided, of course, that
    this extra heat was employed wholly in raising the temperature</em>. Were
    the polar regions free from snow and ice, the greater portion of the
    extra heat would go to raise the temperature. But as those regions
    are covered with snow and ice, the extra heat would have no effect in
    raising the temperature, but would simply melt the snow and ice. The
    ice-covered surface upon which the rays fell could never rise above
    32°. At the period under consideration, the total annual quantity of
    ice melted at the poles would be 1/18th more than at present.</p>

  <p>The general effect which the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic
    would have upon the climate of the polar regions when combined with the
    effects resulting from the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, would be
    this:—When the eccentricity was at a very high value, the hemisphere
    whose winter occurred in the aphelion (for physical reasons, which have
    already been discussed)<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> would be under a condition of glaciation,
    while the other hemisphere, having its winter in perihelion, would be
    enjoying a warm and equable climate. When the obliquity of the ecliptic
    was at a maximum, and 1/18th more heat falling at the poles than at
    present, the effect would be to modify to a great extent the rigour
    of the glaciation in the polar zone of the hemisphere under a glacial
    condition, and, on the other hand, to produce a more rapid melting
    of the ice on the other hemisphere enjoying the equable climate. The
    effects of eccentricity and obliquity thus combined would probably
    completely <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>remove the polar ice-cap from off the latter hemisphere,
    and forest trees might then grow at the pole. Again, when the obliquity
    was at its minimum condition and less heat reaching the poles than at
    present, the glaciation of the former hemisphere would be increased and
    the warmth of the latter diminished.</p>

  <p><em>The Influence of Change in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic on the
    Level of the Sea.</em>—One very remarkable effect which seems to result
    indirectly from a variation of the obliquity under certain conditions,
    is an influence on the level of the sea. As this probably may have had
    something to do with those recent changes of sea-level with which the
    history of the submarine forests and raised beaches have made us all so
    familiar, it may be of interest to enter at some length into this part
    of this subject.</p>

  <p>It appears almost certain that at the time when the northern winter
    solstice was in the aphelion last, a rise of the sea on the northern
    hemisphere to a considerable number of feet must have taken place from
    the combined effect of eccentricity and obliquity. About 11,700 years
    ago, the northern winter solstice was in the aphelion. The eccentricity
    at that time was ·0187, being somewhat greater than it is now; but the
    winters occurring in aphelion instead of, as now, in perihelion, they
    would on that account be probably 10° or 15° colder than they are at
    the present day. It is probable, also, for reasons stated in a previous
    chapter, that the Gulf-stream at that time would be considerably less
    than now. This would tend to lower the temperature to a still greater
    extent. As snow instead of rain must have fallen during winter to a
    greater extent than at present, this no doubt must have produced a
    slight increase in the quantity of ice on the northern hemisphere had
    no other cause come into operation. But the condition of things, we
    have every reason to believe, must have been affected by the greater
    obliquity of the ecliptic at that period. We have no formula, except,
    perhaps, that given by Mr. Stockwell, from which to determine with
    perfect accuracy the extent of the obliquity at a period so remote as
    the one under consideration. If we adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span> the formula given by Struve
    and Peters, which agrees pretty nearly with that obtained from Mr.
    Stockwell’s formula, we have the obliquity at a maximum about the time
    that the solstice-point was in the aphelion. The formula given by
    Leverrier places the maximum somewhat later. At all events, we cannot
    be far from the truth in assuming that at the time the northern winter
    solstice was in the aphelion, the obliquity of the ecliptic would be
    about a maximum, and that since then it has been gradually diminishing.
    It is evident, then, that the annual amount of heat received by the
    arctic regions, and especially about the pole, would be considerably
    greater than at present. And as the heat received on those regions is
    chiefly employed in melting the ice, it is probable that the extra
    amount of ice which would then be melted in the arctic regions would
    prevent that slight increase of ice which would otherwise have resulted
    in consequence of the winter occurring in the aphelion. The winters at
    that period would be colder than they are at present, but the total
    quantity of ice on the northern hemisphere would not probably be
    greater.</p>

  <p>Let us now turn to the southern hemisphere. As the southern winter
    would then occur in the perihelion, this would tend to produce a slight
    decrease in the quantity of ice on the southern hemisphere. But on this
    hemisphere the effects of eccentricity would not, as on the northern
    hemisphere, be compensated by those of obliquity; for both causes would
    here tend to produce the same effect; namely, a melting of the ice in
    the antarctic regions.</p>

  <p>It is probable that at this time the quantity of warm water flowing
    from the equatorial regions into the Southern Ocean would be much
    greater than at present. This would tend to raise the temperature of
    the air of the antarctic regions, and thus assist in melting the ice.
    These causes, combined with the great increase of heat resulting from
    the change of obliquity, would tend to diminish to a considerable
    extent the quantity of ice on the southern hemisphere. I think we may
    assume that the slight increase of eccentricity at that period,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span> the
    occurrence of the southern winter in perihelion, and the extra quantity
    of warm water flowing from the equatorial to the antarctic regions,
    would produce an effect on the south polar ice-cap equal to that
    produced by the increase in the obliquity of the ecliptic. It would,
    therefore, follow that for every eighteen pounds of ice melted annually
    at present at the south pole twenty pounds would then be melted.</p>

  <p>Let us now consider the effect that this condition of things would
    have upon the level of the sea. It would evidently tend to produce an
    elevation of the sea-level on the northern hemisphere in two ways. 1st.
    The addition to the sea occasioned by the melting of the ice from off
    the antarctic land would tend to raise the general level of the sea.
    2ndly. The removal of the ice would also tend to shift the earth’s
    centre of gravity to the north of its present position—and as the sea
    must shift along with the centre, a rise of the sea on the northern
    hemisphere would necessarily take place.</p>

  <p>The question naturally suggests itself, might not the last rise of the
    sea, relative to the land, have resulted from this cause? We know that
    during the period of the 25-foot beach, the time when the estuarine
    mud, which now forms the rich soil of the Carses of the Forth and
    Tay, was deposited, the sea, in relation to the land, stood at least
    20 or 30 feet higher than at present. But immediately prior to this
    period, we have the age of the submarine forests and peat-beds, when
    the sea relative to the land stood lower than it does now. We know
    also that these changes of level were not mere local affairs. There
    seems every reason to believe that our Carse clay, as Mr. Fisher
    states, is the equivalent of the marine mud, with <i>Scrobicularia</i>,
    which covers the submarine forests of England.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> And on the other
    hand, those submarine forests are not confined to one locality. “They
    may be traced,” says Mr. Jamieson, “round the whole of Britain and
    Ireland, from Orkney to Cornwall, from Mayo to the shores of Fife, and
    even, it would seem, along a great part of the western sea-board of
    Europe, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>as if they bore witness to a period of widespread elevation,
    when Ireland and Britain, with all its numerous islands, formed one
    mass of dry land, united to the continent, and stretching out into the
    Atlantic.”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> “These submarine forests”“ remarks De la Beche, also,
    “are to be found under the same general condition from the shores of
    Scandinavia to those of Spain and Portugal, and around the British
    islands.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Those buried forests are not confined to Europe, but
    are found in the valley of the Mississippi and in Nova Scotia, and
    other parts of North America. And again, the strata which underlie
    those forests and peat-beds bear witness to the fact of a previous
    elevation of the sea-level. In short, we have evidence of a number of
    oscillations of sea-level during post-tertiary times.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

  <p>Had there been only one rise of the land relative to the sea-level, or
    one depression, it might quite reasonably, as already remarked, have
    been attributed to an upheaval or a sinking of the ground, occasioned
    by some volcanic, chemical, or other agency. But certainly those
    repeated oscillations of sea-level, extending as they do over so wide
    an area, look more like a rising and sinking of the sea than of the
    land. But, be this as it may, since it is now established, I presume,
    beyond controversy, that the old notion that the general level of the
    sea remains permanent, and that the changes must be all attributed to
    the land is wholly incorrect, and that the sea, as well as the land,
    is subject to changes of level, it is certainly quite legitimate to
    consider whether the last elevation of the sea-level relatively to the
    land may not have resulted from the rising of the sea rather than from
    the sinking of the land, in short, whether it may not be attributed
    to the cause we are now considering. The fact that those raised
    beaches and terraces are found at so many different heights, and also
    so discontinuously <span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>along our coasts, might be urged as an objection
    to the opinion that they were due to changes in the level of the sea
    itself. Space will not permit me to enter upon the discussion of this
    point at present; but it may be stated that this objection is more
    apparent than real. It by no means follows that beaches of the same
    age must be at the same level. This has been shown very clearly by Mr.
    W. Pengelly in a paper on “Raised Beaches,” read before the British
    Association at Nottingham, 1866.</p>

  <p>We have, as I think, evidence amounting to almost absolute certainty
    that 11,700 years ago the general sea-level on the northern hemisphere
    must have been higher than at present. And in order to determine the
    question of the 25-foot beach, we have merely to consider whether a
    rise to something like this extent probably took place at the period in
    question. We have at present no means of determining the exact extent
    of the rise which must have taken place at that period, for we cannot
    tell what quantity of ice was then melted off the antarctic regions.
    But we have the means of making a very rough estimate, which, at least,
    may enable us to determine whether a rise of some 20 or 30 feet may not
    possibly have taken place.</p>

  <p>If we assume that the southern ice-cap extends on an average down
    to lat. 70°, we shall have an area equal to 1/33·163 of the entire
    surface of the globe. The proportion of land to that of water, taking
    into account the antarctic continent, is as 526 to 1272. The southern
    ice-cap will therefore be equal to 1/23·46 of the area covered by
    water. The density of ice to that of water being taken at ·92 to 1,
    it follows that 25 feet 6 inches of ice melted from off the face of
    the antarctic continent would raise the level of the ocean one foot.
    If 470 feet were melted off—and this is by no means an extravagant
    supposition, when we reflect that for every 18 pounds of ice presently
    melted an additional pound or two pounds, or perhaps more, would then
    be melted, and that for many ages in succession—the water thus produced
    from the melted ice would raise the level of the sea 18 feet 5 inches.
    The removal of the 470 feet of solid ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>— which must be but a very
    small fraction of the total quantity of ice lying upon the antarctic
    continent—would shift the earth’s centre of gravity about 7 feet to the
    north of its present position. The shifting of the centre of gravity
    would cause the sea to sink on the southern hemisphere and rise on the
    northern. And the quantity of water thus transferred from the southern
    hemisphere to the northern would carry the centre of gravity about one
    foot further, and thus give a total displacement of the centre to the
    extent of about 8 feet. The sea would therefore rise about 8 feet at
    the North Pole, and in the latitude of Edinburgh about 6 feet 7 inches.
    This, added to the rise of 18 feet 5 inches, occasioned by the melting
    of the ice, would give 25 feet as the total rise in the latitude of
    Scotland 11,700 years ago.</p>

  <p>Each square foot of surface at the poles 11,700 years ago would be
    receiving 18,223,100 foot-pounds more of heat annually than at present.
    If we deduct 22 per cent. as the amount absorbed in passing through the
    atmosphere, we have 14,214,000 foot-pounds. This would be sufficient
    to melt 2·26 feet of ice. But if 50, instead of 22, per cent. were cut
    off, 1·45 cubic feet would be melted. In this case the 470 feet of ice
    would be melted, independently of the effects of eccentricity, in about
    320 years. And supposing that only one-fourth part of the extra heat
    reached the ground, 470 feet of ice would be removed in about 640 years.</p>

  <p>As to the exact time that the obliquity was at a maximum, previous
    to that of 11,700 years ago, our uncertainty is still greater. If we
    are permitted to assume that the ecliptic passes from its maximum to
    its minimum state and back to its maximum again with anything like
    uniformity, at the rate assigned by Leverrier and others, the obliquity
    would not be far from a maximum about 60,000 years ago. Taking the
    rate of precession at 50″·21129, and assuming it to be uniform—which
    it probably is not—the winter solstice would be in the aphelion about
    61,300 years ago.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In short, it seems not at all improbable that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>at the time the solstice-point was in the aphelion, the obliquity of
    the ecliptic would not be far from its maximum state. But at that time
    the value of the eccentricity was 0·023, instead of 0·0187, its value
    at the last period. Consequently the rise of the sea would probably
    be somewhat greater than it was 11,700 years ago. Might not this be
    the period of the 40-foot beach? In this case 11,000 or 12,000 years
    would be the age of the 25-foot beach, and 60,000 years the age of the
    40-foot beach.</p>

  <p>About 22,000 years ago, the winter solstice was in the perihelion, and
    as the eccentricity was then somewhat greater than it is at present,
    the winters would be a little warmer and the climate more equable than
    it is at the present day. This perhaps might be the period of the
    submarine forests and lower peat-beds which underlie the Carse clays,
    <i>Scrobicularia</i> mud, and other deposits belonging to the age of the
    25-foot beach. At any rate, it is perfectly certain that a condition
    of climate at this period prevailed exceedingly favourable to the
    growth of peat. It follows also that at this time, owing to a greater
    accumulation of ice on the southern hemisphere, the sea-level would be
    a few feet lower than at present, and that forests and peat may have
    then grown on places which are now under the sea-level.</p>

  <p>For a few thousand years before and after 11,700 years ago, when the
    winter solstice was evidently not far from the aphelion, and the sea
    standing considerably above its present level, would probably, as we
    have already stated, be the time when the Carse clays and other recent
    deposits lying above the present level of the river were formed.
    And it is also a singular fact that the condition of things at that
    period must <span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>have been exceedingly favourable to the formation of
    such estuarine deposits; for at that time the winter temperature of
    our island, as has been already shown, would be considerably lower
    than at present, and, consequently, during that season, snow, to a
    much larger extent than now, would fall instead of rain. The melting
    of the winter’s accumulation of snow on the approach of summer would
    necessarily produce great floods, similar to what occur in the northern
    parts of Asia and America at the present day from this very same
    cause. The loose upper soil would be carried down by those floods and
    deposited in the estuaries of our rivers.</p>

  <p>The foregoing is a rough and imperfect sketch of the history of the
    climate and the physical conditions of our globe for the past 60,000
    years, in so far as physical and cosmical considerations seem to afford
    us information on the subject, and its striking agreement with that
    derived from geological sources is an additional evidence in favour
    of the opinion that geological and cosmical phenomena are physically
    related by a bond of causation.</p>

  <p><em>Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson’s Theory of the Cause of the Glacial
    Epoch.</em>—In a paper read before the Geological Society by
    Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson, R.A., on the 22nd February, 1871,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> that
    author states, that after calculating from the recorded positions of
    the pole of the heavens during the last 2,000 years, he finds the pole
    of the ecliptic is not the centre of the circle traced by the pole of
    the heavens. The pole of the heavens, he considers, describes a circle
    round a point 6° distant from the pole of the ecliptic and 29° 25′ 47″
    from the pole of the heavens, and that about 13,700 years b.c. the
    angular distance of the two poles was 35° 25′ 47″. This would bring
    the Arctic Circle down to latitude 54° 34′ 13″ N. I fear that this is
    a conclusion that will not be generally accepted by those familiar with
    celestial mechanics. But, be this as it may, my present object is not
    to discuss the astronomical part of Colonel Drayson’s theory, but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>to
    consider whether the conclusions which he deduces from his theory in
    regard to the cause of the glacial epoch be legitimate or not. Assuming
    for argument’s sake that the obliquity of the ecliptic can possibly
    reach to 35° or 36°, so as to bring the Arctic Circle down to the
    centre of England, would this account for the glacial epoch? Colonel
    Drayson concludes that the shifting of the Arctic Circle down to the
    latitude of England would induce here a condition of climate similar
    to that which obtains in arctic regions. This seems to be the radical
    error of the theory. It is perfectly true that were the Arctic Circle
    brought down to latitude 54° 35′ part of our island would be in the
    arctic regions, but it does not on that account follow that our island
    would be subjected to an arctic climate.</p>

  <p>The polar regions owe their cold not to the obliquity of the ecliptic,
    but to their distance from the equator. Indeed were it not for
    obliquity those regions would be much colder than they really are,
    and an increase of obliquity, instead of increasing their cold, would
    really make them warmer. The general effect of obliquity, as we
    have seen, is to diminish the amount of heat received in equatorial
    and tropical regions, and to increase it in the polar and temperate
    regions. The greater the obliquity, and, consequently, the farther
    the sun recedes from the equator, the smaller is the quantity of heat
    received by equatorial regions, and the greater the amount bestowed on
    polar and temperate regions. If, for example, we represent the present
    amount of heat received from the sun at the equator on a given surface
    at 100 parts, 42·47 parts will then represent the amount received at
    the poles on the same given surface. But were the obliquity increased
    to 35° the amount received at the equator would be reduced to 94·93
    parts, and that at the poles increased to 59·81; being an increase at
    the poles of nearly one half. At latitude 60° the present quantity
    is equal to 57 parts; but about 63 parts would be received were the
    obliquity increased to 35°. It therefore follows that although the
    Arctic Circle were brought down to the latitude of London so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span> that the
    British islands would become a part of the arctic regions, the mean
    temperature of these islands would not be lowered, but the reverse.
    The winters would no doubt be colder than they are at present, but the
    cold of winter would be far more than compensated for by the heat of
    summer. It is not a fair representation of the state of things, merely
    to say that an increase of obliquity tends to make the winters colder
    and the summers hotter, for it affects the summer heat far more than
    it does the winter cold. And the greater the obliquity the more does
    the increase of heat during summer exceed the decrease during winter.
    This is obvious because the greater the obliquity the greater the total
    annual amount of heat received.</p>

  <p>If an increase of obliquity tended to produce an increase of ice in
    temperate and polar regions, and thus to lead to a glacial epoch, then
    the greater the obliquity the greater would be the tendency to produce
    such an effect. Conceive, then, the obliquity to go on increasing until
    it ultimately reached its absolute limit, 90°, and the earth’s axis to
    coincide with the plane of the ecliptic. The Arctic Circle would then
    extend to the equator. Would this produce a glacial epoch? Certainly
    not. A square foot of surface at the poles would then be receiving
    as much heat per annum as a square foot at the equator at present,
    supposing the sun remained on the equator during the entire year. Less
    heat, however, would be reaching the equatorial regions than now. At
    present, as we have just seen, the annual quantity of heat received at
    either pole is to that received at the equator as 42·47 to 100; but at
    the period under consideration the poles would be actually obtaining
    one-half more heat than the equator. The amount received per square
    foot at the poles, to that received per square foot at the equator,
    would be in the ratio of half the circumference of a circle to its
    diameter, or as 1·5708 to 1. But merely to say that the poles would be
    receiving more heat per annum than the equator is at present, does not
    convey a correct idea of the excessive heat which the poles would then
    have to endure; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span> it must be borne in mind that the heat reaching
    the equator is spread over the whole year, whereas the poles would get
    their total amount during the six months of their summer. Consequently,
    for six months in the year the poles would be obtaining far more than
    double the quantity of heat received at present by the equator during
    the same length of time, and more than three times the quantity then
    received by the equator. The amount reaching the pole during the six
    months to that reaching the equator would be as 3·1416 to 1.</p>

  <p>At the equator twelve hours’ darkness alternates with twelve hours’
    sunshine, and this prevents the temperature from rising excessively
    high; but at the poles it would be continuous sunshine for six months
    without the ground having an opportunity of cooling for a single
    hour. At the summer solstice, when the sun would be in the zenith of
    the pole, the amount of heat received there every twenty-four hours
    would actually be nearly three-and-a-quarter times greater than that
    presently received at the equator. Now what holds true with regard to
    the poles would hold equally true, though to a lesser extent, of polar
    and temperate regions. We can form but a very inadequate idea of the
    condition of things which would result from such an enormous increase
    of heat. Nothing living on the face of the globe could exist in polar
    regions under so fearful a temperature as would then prevail during
    summer months. How absurd would it be to suppose that this condition
    of things would tend to produce a glacial epoch! Not only would every
    particle of ice in polar regions be dissipated, but the very seas
    around the pole would be, for several months in the year, at the
    boiling point.</p>

  <p>If it could be shown from <em>physical principles</em>—which, to say the
    least, is highly improbable—that the obliquity of the ecliptic could
    ever have been as great as 35°, it would to a very considerable
    extent account for the comparative absence of ice in Greenland and
    other regions in high latitudes, such as we know was the case during
    the Carboniferous, Miocene, and other periods. But although a great
    increase of obliquity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span> might cause a melting of the ice, yet it could
    not produce that mild condition of climate which we know prevailed in
    high latitudes during those periods; while no increase of obliquity,
    however great, could in any way tend to produce a glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>Colonel Drayson, however, seems to admit that this great increase of
    obliquity would make our summers much warmer than they are at present.
    How, then, according to his theory, is the glacial epoch accounted for?
    The following is the author’s explanation as stated in his own words:—</p>

  <p>“At the date 13,700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the same conditions appear to have
    prevailed down to about 54° of latitude during winter as regards the
    sun being only a few degrees above the horizon. We are, then, warranted
    in concluding that the same climate prevailed down to 54° of latitude
    as now exists in winter down to 67° of latitude.</p>

  <p>“Thus in the greater part of England and Wales, and in the whole of
    Scotland, icebergs of large size would be <em>formed each winter</em>; every
    river and stream would be frozen and blocked with ice, the whole
    country would be covered with a mantle of snow and ice, and those
    creatures which could neither migrate nor endure the cold of an arctic
    climate would be exterminated.”—“The Last Glacial Epoch,” p. 146.</p>

  <p>“At the summer solstice the midday altitude of the sun for the latitude
    54° would be about 71½°, an altitude equal to that which the sun
    now attains in the south of Italy, the south of Spain, and in all
    localities having a latitude of about 40°.”</p>

  <p>“There would, however, be this singular difference from present
    conditions, that in latitude 54° the sun at the period of the summer
    solstice would remain the whole twenty-four hours above the horizon;
    a fact which would give extreme heat to those very regions which, six
    months previously, had been subjected to an arctic cold. Not only
    would this greatly increased heat prevail in the latitude of 54°, but
    the sun’s altitude would be 12° greater at midday in midsummer, and
    also 12° greater at midnight in high northern latitudes, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span> it
    ever attains now; consequently the heat would be far greater than at
    present, and high northern regions, even around the pole itself, would
    be subjected to a heat during summer far greater than any which now
    ever exists in those localities. The natural consequence would be, that
    the icebergs and ice which had during the severe winter accumulated in
    high latitudes would be rapidly thawed by this heat” (p. 148).</p>

  <p>“Each winter the whole northern and southern hemispheres would be one
    mass of ice; each summer nearly the whole of the ice of each hemisphere
    would be melted and dispersed” (p. 150).</p>

  <p>According to this theory, not only is the whole country covered each
    winter with a continuous mass of ice, but large icebergs are formed
    during that short season, and when the summer heat sets in all is
    melted away. Here we have a misapprehension not only as to the actual
    condition of things during the glacial epoch, but even as to the way
    in which icebergs and land-ice are formed. Icebergs are formed from
    land-ice, but land-ice is not formed during a single winter, much
    less a mass of sufficient thickness to produce icebergs. Land-ice of
    this thickness requires the accumulated snows of centuries for its
    production. All that we could really have, according to this theory,
    would be a thick covering of snow during winter, which would entirely
    disappear during summer, so that there could be no land-ice.</p>

  <p><em>Mr. Thomas Belt’s Theory.</em>—The theory that the glacial epoch resulted
    from a great increase in the obliquity of the ecliptic has recently
    been advocated by Mr. Thomas Belt.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> His conceptions on the subject,
    however, appear to me to be even more irreconcilable with physics than
    those we have been considering. Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson admits that
    the increase of heat to polar regions resulting from the great increase
    of obliquity would dissipate the ice there, but Mr. Belt does not even
    admit that an increase of obliquity would bring with it an increase of
    heat, far less that it would melt the polar ice. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>On the contrary, he
    maintains that the tendency of obliquity is to increase the rigour of
    polar climate, and that this is the reason “that now around the poles
    some lands are being glaciated, for excepting for that obliquity snow
    and ice would not accumulate, excepting on mountain chains.” “Thus,”
    he says, “there exist glacial conditions at present around the poles,
    due primarily to the obliquity of the ecliptic.” And he also maintains
    that if there were no obliquity and the earth’s axis were perpendicular
    to the plane of its orbit, an eternal “spring would reign around the
    arctic circle,” and that “under such circumstances the piling up of
    snow, or even its production at the sea-level, would be impossible,
    excepting perhaps in the immediate neighbourhood of the poles, where
    the rays of the sun would have but little heating power from its small
    altitude.”</p>

  <p>Mr. Belt has apparently been led to these strange conclusions by the
    following singular misapprehension of the effects of obliquity on
    the distribution of the sun’s heat over the globe. “The obliquity of
    the ecliptic,” he remarks, “<em>does not affect the mean amount of heat
    received at any one point from the sun</em>, but it causes the heat and the
    cold to predominate at different seasons of the year.”</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to dwell further on the absurdity of the
    supposition that an increase of obliquity can possibly account for the
    glacial epoch, but we may in a few words consider whether a decrease
    of obliquity would mitigate the climate and remove the snow from
    polar regions. Supposing obliquity to disappear and the earth’s axis
    to become perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, it is perfectly
    true that day and night would be equal all over the globe, but then
    the quantity of heat received by the polar regions would be far less
    than at present. It is well known that at present at the equinoxes,
    when day and night are equal, snow and not rain prevails in the arctic
    regions, and can we suppose it could be otherwise in the case under
    consideration? How, we may well ask, could these regions, deprived of
    their summer, get rid of their snow and ice?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span></p>

  <p>But even supposing it could be shown that a change in the obliquity of
    the ecliptic to the extent assumed by Mr. Belt and Lieutenant-Colonel
    Drayson would produce a glacial epoch, still the assumption of such a
    change is one which physical astronomy will not permit. Mr. Belt does
    not appear to dispute the accuracy of the methods by which it is proved
    that the variations of obliquity are confined within narrow limits; but
    he maintains that physical astronomers, in making their calculations
    have left out of account some circumstances which materially affect the
    problem. These, according to Mr. Belt, are the following:—(1) Upheavals
    and subsidences of the land which may have taken place in past ages.
    (2) The unequal distribution of sea and land on the globe. (3) The fact
    that the equatorial protuberance is not a regular one, “but approaches
    in a general outline to an ellipse, of which the greater diameter is
    two miles longer than the other.” (4) The heaping up of ice around the
    poles during the glacial period.</p>

  <p>We may briefly consider whether any or all of these can sensibly affect
    the question at issue. In reference to the last-mentioned element, it
    is no doubt true that if an immense quantity of water were removed
    from the ocean and placed around the poles in the form of ice it would
    affect the obliquity of the ecliptic; but this is an element of change
    which is not available to Mr. Belt, because according to his theory
    the piling up of the ice is an effect which results from the change of
    obliquity.</p>

  <p>In reference to the difference of two miles in the equatorial diameters
    of the earth, the fact must be borne in mind that the longer diameter
    passes through nearly the centre of the great depression of the Pacific
    Ocean,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> whereas the shorter diameter passes through the opposite
    continents of Asia and America. Now, when we take into consideration
    the fact that these continents are not only two-and-a-half times denser
    than the ocean, but have a mean elevation of about 1,000 feet above
    the sea-level, it becomes perfectly obvious that the earth’s mass must
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>be pretty evenly distributed around its axis of rotation, and that
    therefore the difference in the equatorial diameters can exercise no
    appreciable effect on the change of obliquity. It follows also that the
    present arrangement of sea and land is the best that could be chosen to
    prevent disturbance of motion.</p>

  <p>That there ever were upheavals and depressions of the land of so
    enormous a magnitude as to lead to a change of obliquity to the extent
    assumed by Lieutenant-Colonel Drayson and Mr. Belt is what, I presume,
    few geologists would be willing to admit. Suppose the great table-land
    of Thibet, with the Himalaya Mountains, were to sink under the sea,
    it would hardly produce any sensible effect on the obliquity of the
    ecliptic. Nay more; supposing that all the land in the globe were sunk
    under the sea-level, or the ocean beds converted into dry land, still
    this would not materially affect obliquity. The reason is very obvious.
    The equatorial bulge is so immense that those upheavals and depressions
    would not to any great extent alter the oblate form of the earth. The
    only cause which could produce any sensible effect on obliquity, as has
    already been noticed, would be the removal of the water of the ocean
    and the piling of it up in the form of ice around the poles; but this
    is a cause which is not available to Mr. Belt.</p>

  <p><em>Sir Charles Lyell’s Theory.</em>—I am also unable to agree with Sir
    Charles Lyell’s conclusions in reference to the influence of the
    obliquity of the ecliptic on climate. Sir Charles says, “It may be
    remarked that if the obliquity of the ecliptic could ever be diminished
    to the extent of four degrees below its present inclination, such a
    deviation would be of geological interest, in so far as it would cause
    the sun’s light to be disseminated over a broader zone inside of the
    arctic and antarctic circles. Indeed, if the date of its occurrence in
    past time could be ascertained, this greater spread of the solar rays,
    implying a shortening of the polar night, might help in some slight
    degree to account for a vegetation such as now characterizes lower
    latitudes, having had in the Miocene and Carboniferous periods a much
    wider range towards the pole.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span></p>

  <p>The effects, as we have seen, would be directly the reverse of what is
    here stated, viz., the more the obliquity was diminished the <em>less</em>
    would the sun’s rays spread over the arctic and antarctic regions, and
    conversely the more the obliquity was increased the <em>greater</em> would
    be the amount of heat spread over polar latitudes. The farther the
    sun recedes from the equator, the greater becomes the amount of heat
    diffused over the polar regions; and if the obliquity could possibly
    attain its absolute limit (90°), it is obvious that the poles would
    then be receiving more heat than the equator is now.</p>

  <p><em>An Inter-glacial Climate the one best suited for the Growth of the
    Coal Plants.</em>—No assertion, perhaps, could appear more improbable,
    or is more opposed to all hitherto received theories, than the one
    that the plants which form our coal grew during a glacial epoch. But,
    nevertheless, if the theory of secular changes of climate, discussed
    in the foregoing chapters, be correct, we have in warm inter-glacial
    periods (as was pointed out several years ago)<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> the very condition
    of climate best suited for the growth of those kinds of trees and
    vegetation of which our coal is composed. It is the generally received
    opinion among both geologists and botanists that the flora of the Coal
    period does not indicate the existence of a tropical, but a moist,
    equable, and temperate climate. “It seems to have become,” says Sir
    Charles Lyell, “a more and more received opinion that the coal plants
    do not on the whole indicate a climate resembling that now enjoyed in
    the equatorial zone. Tree-ferns range as far south as the southern
    parts of New Zealand, and Araucanian pines occur in Norfolk Island.
    A great preponderance of ferns and lycopodiums <span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>indicates moisture,
    equability of temperature, and freedom from frost, rather than intense
    heat.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Brown, the eminent botanist, considers that the rapid and
    great growth of many of the coal plants showed that they grew in swamps
    and shallow water of equable and genial temperature.</p>

  <p>“Generally speaking,” says Professor Page, “we find them resembling
    equisetums, marsh-grasses, reeds, club-mosses, tree-ferns, and
    coniferous trees; and these in existing nature attain their maximum
    development in warm, temperate, and subtropical, rather than in
    equatorial regions. The Wellingtonias of California and the pines of
    Norfolk Island are more gigantic than the largest coniferous tree yet
    discovered in the coal-measures.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

  <p>The Coal period was not only characterized by a great preponderance
    over the present in the quantity of ferns growing, but also in the
    number of different species. Our island possesses only about 50
    species, while no fewer than 140 species have been enumerated as having
    inhabited those few isolated places in England over which the coal has
    been worked. And Humboldt has shown that it is not in the hot, but in
    the mountainous, humid, and shady parts of the equatorial regions that
    the family of ferns produces the greatest number of species.</p>

  <p>“Dr. Hooker thinks that a climate warmer than ours now is, would
    probably be indicated by the presence of an increased number of
    flowering plants, which would doubtless have been fossilized with
    the ferns; whilst a lower temperature, <em>equal to the mean of the
    seasons now prevailing</em>, would assimilate our climate to that of such
    cooler countries as are characterized by a disproportionate amount of
    ferns.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

  <p>“The general opinion of the highest authorities,” says Professor Hull,
    “appears to be that the climate did not resemble that of the equatorial
    regions, but was one in which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>the temperature was free from extremes;
    the atmosphere being warm and moist, somewhat resembling that of New
    Zealand and the surrounding islands, which we endeavour to imitate
    artificially in our hothouses.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

  <p>The enormous quantity of the carboniferous vegetation shows also that
    the climate under which it grew could not have been of a tropical
    character, or it must have been decomposed by the heat. Peat, so
    abundant in temperate regions, is not to be found in the tropics.</p>

  <p>The condition most favourable to the preservation of vegetable remains,
    at least under the form of peat, is a cool, moist, and equable climate,
    such as prevails in the Falkland Islands at the present day. “In these
    islands,” says Mr. Darwin, “almost every kind of plant, even the coarse
    grass which covers the whole surface of the land, becomes converted
    into this substance.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

  <p>From the evidence of geology we may reasonably infer that were
    the difference between our summer and winter temperature nearly
    annihilated, and were we to enjoy an equable climate equal to, or
    perhaps a little above, the present mean annual temperature of our
    island, we should then have a climate similar to what prevailed during
    the Carboniferous epoch.</p>

  <p>But we have already seen that such must have been the character of our
    climate at the time that the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit was at
    a maximum, and winter occurred when the earth was in the perihelion of
    its orbit. For, as we have already shown, the earth would in such a
    case be 14,212,700 miles nearer to the sun in winter than in summer.
    This enormous difference, along with other causes which have been
    discussed, would almost extinguish the difference between summer and
    winter temperature. The almost if not entire absence of ice and snow,
    resulting from this condition of things, would, as has already been
    shown, tend to raise the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>mean annual temperature of the climate higher
    than it is at present.</p>

  <p><em>Conditions necessary for the Preservation of the Coal Plants.</em>—But
    in order to the formation of coal, it is not simply necessary to have
    a condition of climate suitable for the growth, but also for the
    preservation, of a luxuriant vegetation. The very existence of coal is
    as much due to the latter circumstance as to the former; nay more, as
    we shall yet see, the fact that a greater amount of coal belongs to the
    Carboniferous period than to any other, was evidently due not so much
    to a more extensive vegetable growth during that age, suited to form
    coal, as to the fact that that flora has been better preserved. Now,
    as will be presently shown, we have not merely in the warm periods of
    a glacial epoch a condition of climate best suited for the growth of
    coal plants, but we have also in the cold periods of such an epoch the
    condition most favourable for the preservation of those plants.</p>

  <p>One circumstance necessary for the preservation of plants is that they
    should have been covered over by a thick deposit of sand, mud, or clay,
    and for this end it is necessary that the area upon which the plants
    grew should have become submerged. It is evident that unless the area
    had become submerged, the plants could not have been covered over with
    a thick deposit; and, even supposing they had been covered over, they
    could not have escaped destruction from subaërial denudation unless
    the whole had been under water. Another condition favourable, if not
    essential, to the preservation of the plants, is that they should have
    been submerged in a cold and not in a warm sea. Assuming that the
    coal plants grew during a warm period of a glacial epoch, we have in
    the cold period which succeeded all the above conditions necessarily
    secured.</p>

  <p>It is now generally admitted that the coal trees grew near broad
    estuaries and on immense flat plains but little elevated above
    sea-level. But that the <i>Lepidodendra</i>, <i>Sigillariæ</i>, and other trees,
    of which our coal is almost wholly composed, grew on dry ground,
    elevated above sea-level, and not in swamps and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span> shallow water, as
    was at one time supposed, has been conclusively established by the
    researches of Principal Dawson and others. After the growth of many
    generations of trees, the plain is eventually submerged under the sea,
    and the whole, through course of time, becomes covered over with thick
    deposits of sand, gravel, and other sediments carried down by streams
    from the adjoining land. After this the submerged plain becomes again
    elevated above the sea-level, and forms the site of a second forest,
    which, after continuing to flourish for long centuries, is in turn
    destroyed by submergence, and, like the former, becomes covered over
    with deposits from the land. This alternate process of submergence
    and emergence goes on till we have a succession of buried forests
    one above another, with immense stratified deposits between. These
    buried forests ultimately become converted into beds of coal. This,
    I presume, is a fair representation of the generally admitted way in
    which our coal-beds had their origin. It is also worthy of notice that
    the stratified beds between the coal-seams are of marine and not of
    lacustrine origin. On this point I may quote the opinion of Professor
    Hull, a well-known authority on the subject: “Whilst admitting,” he
    says, “the occasional presence of lacustrine strata associated with the
    coal-measures, I think we may conclude that the whole formation has
    been essentially of marine and estuarine origin.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

  <p><em>Coal-beds necessarily imply Oscillations of Sea-level.</em>—It may also
    be observed that each coal-seam indicates both an elevation and a
    depression of the land. If, for example, there are six coal-seams,
    one above the other, this proves that the land must have been, at
    least, six times below and six times above sea-level. This repeated
    oscillation of the land has been regarded as a somewhat puzzling and
    singular circumstance. But if we assume coal to be an inter-glacial
    formation, this difficulty not only disappears, but all the various
    circumstances which we have been detailing are readily explained.
    We have to begin with a warm inter-glacial period, with a climate
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>specially suited for the growth of the coal trees. During this period,
    as has been shown in the chapter on Submergence, the sea would be
    standing at a lower level than at present, laying bare large tracts
    of sea-bottom, on which would flourish the coal vegetation. This
    condition of things would continue for a period of 8,000 or 10,000
    years, allowing the growth of many generations of trees. When the warm
    period came to a close, and the cold and glacial condition set in, the
    climate became unsuited for the growth of the coal plants. The sea
    would begin to rise, and the old sea-bottoms on which, during so long
    a period, the forests grew, would be submerged and become covered by
    sedimentary deposits brought down from the land. These forests becoming
    submerged in a cold sea, and buried under an immense mass of sediment,
    were then now protected from destruction, and in a position to become
    converted into coal. The cold continuing for a period of 10,000 years,
    or thereby, would be succeeded by another warm period, during which the
    submerged areas became again a land-surface, on which a second forest
    flourished for another 10,000 years, which in turn became submerged
    and buried under drift on the approach of the second cold period.
    This alternate process of submergence and emergence of the land,
    corresponding to the rise and fall of sea-level during the cold and
    warm periods, would continue so long as the eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit remained at a high value, till we might have, perhaps, five or
    six submerged forests, one above the other, and separated by great
    thicknesses of stratified deposits, these submerged forests being the
    coal-beds of the present day.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is probable that the forests of the Coal period would extend inland
    over the country, but only such portions as were slightly elevated
    above sea-level would be submerged and covered over by sediment and
    thus be preserved, and ultimately become coal-seams. The process will
    be better understood from the following diagram. Let A B represent the
    surface of the ground prior to a glacial epoch, and to the formation
    of the beds of coal and stratified deposits represented in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span> the
    diagram. Let S S′ be the normal sea-level. Suppose the eccentricity
    of the earth’s orbit begins to increase, and the winter solstice
    approaches the perihelion, we have then a moderately warm period. The
    sea-level sinks to 1, and forests of sigillariæ and other coal trees
    cover the country from the sea-shore at 1, stretching away inland in
    the direction of B. In course of time the winter solstice moves round
    to aphelion and a cold period follows. The sea begins to rise and
    continues rising till it reaches 1′. Denudation and the severity of
    the climate destroy every vestige of the forest from 1′ backwards into
    the interior; but the portion 1 1′ being submerged and covered over
    by sediment brought down from the land is preserved. The eccentricity
    continuing to increase in extent, the second inter-glacial period is
    more warm and equable than the first, and the sea this time sinks to 2.
    A second forest now covers the country down to the sea-shore at 2. This
    second warm period is followed by the second cold period, more severe
    than the first, and the sea-level rises to 2′. Denudation and severity
    of climate now destroy every remnant of the forest, from 2′ inland,
    but of course the submerged portion of 2 2′, like the former portion 1
    1′, is preserved. During the third warm period (the eccentricity being
    still on the increase) the sea-level sinks to 3, and the country for
    the third time is covered by forests, which extend down to 3. This
    third warm period is followed by a cold glacial period more severe than
    the preceding, and the sea-level rises to 3′, and the submerged portion
    of the forest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span> from 3 to 3′ becomes covered with drift,—the rest as
    before being destroyed by denudation and the severity of the climate.
    We shall assume that the eccentricity has now reached a maximum, and
    that during the fourth inter-glacial period the sea-level sinks only to
    4, the level to which it sank during the second inter-glacial period.
    The country is now covered for the fourth time by forests. The cold
    period which succeeds not being so severe as the last, the sea rises
    only to 4′, which, of course, marks the limit of the fourth forest. The
    eccentricity continuing to diminish, the fifth forest is only submerged
    up to 5′, and the sixth and last one up to 6′. The epoch of cold and
    warm periods being now at a close, the sea-level remains stationary at
    its old normal position S S′. Here we have six buried forests, the one
    above the other, which, through course of ages, become transformed into
    coal-beds.</p>

  <p>It does not, however, necessarily follow that each separate coal-seam
    represents a warm period. It is quite possible that two or more seams
    separated from each other by thin partings or a few feet of sedimentary
    strata might have been formed during one warm period; for during a warm
    period minor oscillations of sea-level sufficient to submerge the land
    to some depth might quite readily have taken place from the melting of
    polar ice, as was shown in the chapter on Submergence.</p>

  <p>It may be noticed that in order to make the section more distinct, its
    thickness has been greatly exaggerated. It will also be observed that
    beds 4, 5, and 6 extend considerably to the left of what is represented
    in the section.</p>

  <p>But it is not to be supposed that the whole phenomena of the
    coal-fields can be explained without supposing a subsidence of the
    land. The great depth to which the coal-beds have been sunk, in many
    cases, must be attributed to a subsidence of the level. A series of
    beds formed during a glacial epoch, may, owing to a subsidence of the
    land, be sunk to a great depth, and become covered over with thousands
    of feet of sediment; and then on the occurrence of another glacial
    epoch, a new series of coal-beds may be formed on the surface. Thus
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span> upper series may be separated from the lower by thousands of feet
    of sedimentary rock. There is another consequence resulting from the
    sinking of the land, which must be taken into account. Had there been
    no sinking of the land during the Carboniferous age, the quantity of
    coal-beds now remaining would be far less than it actually is, for it
    is in a great measure owing to their being sunk to a great depth that
    they have escaped destruction by the enormous amount of denudation
    which has taken place since that remote age. It therefore follows that
    only a very small fraction of the submerged forests of the Coal period
    do actually now exist in the form of coal. Generally it would only be
    those areas which happened to be sunk to a considerable depth, by a
    subsidence of the land, that would escape destruction from denudation.
    But no doubt the areas which would thus be preserved bear but a small
    proportion to those destroyed.</p>

  <p><em>Length of Inter-glacial Period, as indicated by the Thickness of a
    Bed of Coal.</em>—A fact favourable to the idea that the coal-seams were
    formed during inter-glacial periods is, that the length of those
    periods agrees pretty closely with the length of time supposed to be
    required to form a coal-seam of average thickness. Other things being
    equal, the thickness of a coal-seam would depend upon the length
    of the inter-glacial period. If the rate of precession and motion
    of the perihelion were always uniform the periods would all be of
    equal length. But although the rate of precession is not subject to
    much variation, such is not the case in regard to the motion of the
    perihelion, as will be seen from the tables of the longitude of the
    perihelion given in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX.</a> Sometimes the motion of the perihelion
    is rapid, at other times slow, while in some cases its motion is
    retrograde. In consequence of this, an inter-glacial period may not be
    more than some six or seven thousand years in length, while in other
    cases its length may be as much as fifteen or sixteen thousand years.</p>

  <p>According to Boussingault, luxuriant vegetation at the present day
    takes from the atmosphere about a half ton of carbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span> per acre
    annually, or fifty tons per acre in a century. Fifty tons of carbon of
    the specific gravity of coal, about 1·5, spread evenly over the surface
    of an acre, would make a layer nearly one-third of an inch.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
    Humboldt makes the estimate a little higher, viz., one half-inch.
    Taking the latter estimate, it would require 7,200 years to form a
    bed of coal a yard thick. Dr. Heer, of Zurich, thinks that it would
    not require more than 1,400 years to form a bed of coal one yard
    thick;<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> while Mr. Maclaren thinks that a bed of coal one yard thick
    would be formed in 1,000 years.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Professor Phillip, calculating
    from the amount of carbon taken from the atmosphere, as determined by
    Liebig, considers that if it were converted into ordinary coal with
    about 75 per cent. of carbon, it would yield one inch in 127·5 years,
    or a yard in 4,600 years.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

  <p>There is here a considerable amount of difference in regard to the time
    required to form a yard of coal. The truth, however, may probably be
    somewhere between the two extremes, and we may assume 5,000 years to be
    about the time. In a warm period of 15,000 years we should then have
    deposited a seam of coal 9 feet thick, while during a warm period of
    7,000 years we would have a seam of only 4 feet.</p>

  <p><em>Reason why the Coal Strata present so little Evidence of
    Ice-action.</em>—There are two objections which will, no doubt, present
    themselves to the reader’s mind. (1.) If coal be an inter-glacial
    formation, why do the coal strata present so little evidence of
    ice-action? If the coal-seams represent warm inter-glacial periods, the
    intervening beds must represent cold or glacial periods, and if so,
    they ought to contain more abundant evidence of ice-action than they
    really do. (2.) In the case of the glacial epoch, almost every vestige
    of the vegetation of the warm periods was destroyed by the ice of the
    cold periods; why then did not the same thing take place during the
    glacial epoch of the Carboniferous period?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span></p>

  <p>During the glacial epoch the face of the country was in all
    probability covered for ages with the most luxuriant vegetation; but
    scarcely a vestige of that vegetation now remains, indeed the very soil
    upon which it grew is not to be found. All that now remains is the
    wreck and desolation produced by the ice-sheet that covered the country
    during the cold periods of that epoch, consisting of transported blocks
    of stones, polished and grooved rocks, and a confused mass of boulder
    clay. Here we have in this epoch nothing tangible presenting itself
    but the destructive effects of the ice which swept over the land. Why,
    then, in reference to the glacial epochs of the Carboniferous age
    should we have such abundant evidence of the vegetation of the warm
    periods, and yet so little evidence of the effect of the ice of the
    cold periods? The answer to these two objections will go a great way
    to explain why we have so much coal belonging to the Carboniferous
    age, and so little belonging to any other age; and it will, I think,
    be found in the peculiar physical character of the country during
    the Carboniferous age. The areas on which the forests of the Coal
    period grew escaped the destructive power of glaciers and land-ice on
    account of the flat nature of the ground. There are few points on which
    geologists are more unanimous than in regard to the flat character of
    the country during the Coal period.</p>

  <p>There does not seem to be any very satisfactory evidence that the
    interior of the country rose to any very great elevation. Mr.
    Godwin-Austen thinks that during the Coal period there must have
    been “a vast expanse of continuous horizontal surface at very slight
    elevations above the sea-level.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Of the widely spread terrestrial
    surface of the Coal-measure period, portions, he believes, attained
    a considerable elevation. But in contrast to this he states, “There
    is a feature which seems to distinguish this period physically from
    all subsequent periods, and which consists in the vast expanse of
    continuous horizontal surface which the land area presented, bordering
    on, and at very slight elevations above, the sea-level.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Hugh
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>Miller, describing in his usual graphic way the appearance of the
    country during the Coal period, says:—“It seems to have been a land
    consisting of immense flats, unvaried, mayhap, by a <em>single hill</em>,
    in which dreary swamps, inhabited by doleful creatures, spread out
    on every hand for hundreds and thousands of miles; and a gigantic
    and monstrous vegetation formed, as I have shown, the only prominent
    features of the scenery.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

  <p>Now, if this is in any way like a just representation of the general
    features of the country during the Coal period, it was physically
    impossible, no matter however severe the climate may have been,
    that there could have been in this country at that period anything
    approaching to continental ice, or perhaps even to glaciers of such
    dimensions as would reach down to near the sea-level, where the coal
    vegetation now preserved is supposed chiefly to have grown. The
    condition of things which would prevail would more probably resemble
    that of Siberia than that of Greenland.</p>

  <p>The absence of all traces of ice-action in the strata of the
    coal-measures can in this case be easily explained. For as by
    supposition there were no glaciers, there could have been no
    scratching, grooving, or polishing of the rocks; neither could there
    have been any icebergs, for the large masses known as icebergs are
    the terminal portions of glaciers which have reached down to the sea.
    Again, there being no icebergs, there of course could have been no
    grinding or scratching of the rocks forming the floor of the ocean.
    True, during summer, when the frozen sea broke up, we should then
    have immense masses of floating ice, but these masses would not be of
    sufficient thickness to rub against the sea-bottom. But even supposing
    that they did occasionally touch the bottom here and there, we could
    not possibly find the evidence of this in any of the strata of the
    coal-measures. We could not expect to find any scratchings or markings
    on the sandstone or shale of those strata indicating the action of
    ice, for at that period there were no beds of sandstone or shale, but
    simply beds of sand and mud, which in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>future ages became consolidated
    into sandstone and shale. A mass of ice might occasionally rub along
    the sea-bottom, and leave its markings on the loose sand or soft mud
    forming that bottom, but the next wave that passed over it would
    obliterate every mark, and leave the surface as smooth as before.
    Neither could we expect to find any large erratics or boulders in the
    coal strata, for these must come from the land, and as by supposition
    there were no glaciers or land-ice at that period, there was therefore
    no means of transporting them. In Greenland the icebergs sometimes
    carry large boulders, which are dropped into the sea as the icebergs
    melt away; but these blocks have all either been transported on the
    backs of glaciers from inland tracts, or have fallen on the field-ice
    along the shore from the face of crags and overhanging precipices.
    But as there were probably neither glaciers reaching to the sea, nor
    perhaps precipitous cliffs along the sea-shore, there could have been
    few or no blocks transported by ice and dropped into the sea of the
    Carboniferous period, and of course we need not expect to find them in
    the sandstone and shale which during that epoch formed the bed of the
    ocean. There would no doubt be coast-line ice and ground-ice in rivers,
    carrying away large quantities of gravel and stones; but these gravels
    and stones would of course be all water-worn, and although found in the
    strata of the coal-measures, as no doubt they actually are, they would
    not be regarded as indicating the action of ice. The simple absence of
    relics of ice-action in the coal-measures proves nothing whatever in
    regard to whether there were cold periods during their formation or not.</p>

  <p>This comparative absence of continental ice might be one reason why
    the forests of the Carboniferous period have been preserved to a much
    greater extent than those of any other age.</p>

  <p>It must be observed, however, that the conclusions at which we have
    arrived in reference to the comparative absence of continental ice
    applies only to the areas which now constitute our coal-fields. The
    accumulation of ice on the antarctic regions, and on some parts of
    the arctic regions, might have been as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span> great during that age as it
    is at present. Had there been no continental ice there could have
    been no such oscillations of sea-level as is assumed in the foregoing
    theory. The leading idea of the theory, expressed in a few words,
    is, that the glacial epochs of the Carboniferous age were as severe,
    and the accumulation of ice as great, as during any other age, only
    there were large tracts of flat country, but little elevated above the
    sea-level, which were not covered by ice. These plains, during the
    warm inter-glacial periods, were covered with forests of sigillariæ
    and other coal trees. Portions of those forests were protected by the
    submergence which resulted from the rise of the sea-level during the
    cold or glacial periods and the subsequent subsidence of the land.
    Those portions now constitute our coal-beds.</p>

  <p>But that coal may be an inter-glacial formation is no mere hypothesis,
    for we have in the well-known Dürnten beds—described in <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter XV.</a>—an
    actual example of such a formation.</p>

  <p><em>Carboniferous Limestones.</em>—As a general rule the limestones of the
    Carboniferous period, like the coal, are found in beds separated by
    masses of sandstone and other stratified deposits, which proves that
    the corals, crinoids, and other creatures, of the remains of which it
    is composed, did not live continuously on during the entire Limestone
    period. These limestones are a marine formation. If the land was
    repeatedly submerged the coal must of necessity have been produced in
    seams with stratified deposits between, but there is no reason why the
    same should have been the case with the limestones. If the climatic
    condition of the sea continued the same we should not have expected
    this alternate succession of life and death; but, according to the
    theory of alternate cold and warm periods, such a condition follows
    as a necessary consequence, for during the warm periods, when the
    land was covered with a luxuriant vegetation, the sea-bottom would be
    covered with mollusca, crinoids, corals, &amp;c., fitted to live only in a
    moderately warm sea; but when the cold came on those creatures would
    die, and their remains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span> during the continuance of the cold period,
    would become slowly covered over with deposits of sand and clay. On the
    return of the warm period those deposits would soon become covered with
    life as before, forming another bed of limestone, and this alternation
    of life and death would go on as long as the glacial epoch continued.</p>

  <p>It is true that in Derbyshire, and in the south of Ireland and some
    other places, the limestone is found in one mass of several hundred
    feet in thickness without any beds of sandstone or shale, but then it
    is nowhere found in one continuous mass from top to bottom without any
    lines of division. These breaks or divisions may as distinctly mark
    a cold period as though they had been occupied by beds of sandstone.
    The marine creatures ceased to exist, and when the rough surface left
    by their remains became smoothed down by the action of the waves into
    a flat plain, another bed would begin to form upon this floor so
    soon as life again appeared. Two agencies working together probably
    conspired to produce these enormous masses of limestone divided only
    by breaks marking different periods of elaboration. Corals grow in
    warm seas, and there only in water of a depth ranging from 20 to 30
    fathoms. The cold of a period of glaciation would not only serve to
    destroy them, but they would be submerged so much beyond the depth
    proper for their existence that even were it possible that with the
    submergence a sufficient temperature was left, they would inevitably
    perish from the superincumbent mass of water. We are therefore, as
    it seems to me, warranted in concluding that the separate masses of
    Derbyshire limestone were formed during warm inter-glacial periods,
    and that the lines of division represent cold periods of glaciation
    during which the animals perished by the combined influence of cold and
    pressure of water. The submergence of the coral banks in deep water on
    a sea-bottom, which, like the land, was characteristically flat and
    even, implies its carrying away far into the bosom of the ocean, and
    consequently remote from any continent and the river-borne detritus
    thereof.</p>

  <p><em>The Nature of the Caithness Boulder Clay.</em>—A considerable amount of
    difficulty has been felt by geologists in accounting for the origin of
    the boulder clay of Caithness. It is an unstratified clay, of a deep
    grey or slaty colour, resembling much that of the Caithness flags on
    which it rests. It is thus described by Mr. Jamieson (Quart. Jour.
    Geol. Soc., vol. xxii., p. 261):—</p>

  <p>“The glacial drift of Caithness is particularly interesting as an
    example of a boulder clay which in its mode of accumulation and
    ice-scratched <i lang="fr">débris</i> very much resembles that unstratified stony mud
    which occurs underneath glaciers—the ‘<i>moraine profonde</i>,’ as some call it.</p>

  <p>“The appearance of the drift along the Haster Burn, and in many other
    places in Caithness, is in fact precisely the same as that of the old
    boulder clay of the rest of Scotland, except that it is charged with
    remains of sea-shells and other marine organisms.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span></p>

  <p>“If want of stratification, hardness of texture, and abundance of
    well-glaciated stones and boulders are to be the tests for what we call
    genuine boulder clay, then much of the Caithness drift will stand the
    ordeal.”</p>

  <p>So far, therefore, as the mere appearance of the drift is concerned,
    it would at once be pronounced to be true Lower Till, the product of
    land-ice. But there are two circumstances connected with it which have
    been generally regarded as fatal to this conclusion.</p>

  <p>(1) The striæ on the rocks show that the ice which formed the clay
    must have come from the sea, and not from the interior of the country;
    for their direction is almost at right angles to what it would have
    been had the ice come from the interior. Over the whole district, the
    direction of the grooves and scratches, not only of the rocks but
    even of the stones in the clay, is pretty nearly N.W. and S.E. “When
    examining the sections along the Haster Burn,” says Mr. Jamieson, “in
    company with Mr. Joseph Anderson, I remarked that the striæ on the
    imbedded fragments generally agreed in direction with those of the
    rocks beneath. The scratches on the boulders, as usual, run lengthways
    along the stones when they are of an elongated form; and the position
    of these stones, as they lie imbedded in the drift, is, as a rule, such
    that their longer axes point in the same direction as do the scratches
    on the solid rock beneath; showing that the same agency that scored the
    rocks also ground and pushed along the drift.”</p>

  <p>Mr. C. W. Peach informs me that he seldom or never found a stone with
    two sets of striæ on it, a fact indicating, as Mr. Jamieson remarks,
    that the drift was produced by one great movement invariably in the
    same direction. Let it be borne in mind that the ice, which thus moved
    over Caithness in this invariable track, must either have come from the
    Atlantic to the N.W., or from the Moray Firth to the S.E.</p>

  <p>(2) The boulder clay of Caithness is full of sea-shells and other
    marine remains. The shells are in a broken condition, and are
    interspersed like the stones through the entire mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span> the clay.
    Mr. Jamieson states that he nowhere observed any instance of shells
    being found in an undisturbed condition, “nor could I hear,” he says,
    “of any such having been found; there seems to be no such thing as a
    bed of laminated silt with shells <i lang="la">in situ</i>.” The shell-fragments are
    scratched and ice-worn, the same as the stones found in the clay. Not
    only are the shells glaciated, but even the foraminifera, when seen
    through the microscope, have a rubbed and worn appearance. The shells
    have evidently been broken, striated, and pushed along by the ice at
    the time the boulder clay was being formed.</p>

  <p><em>Theories regarding the Origin of the Caithness Clay.</em>—Mr. Jamieson, as
    we have seen, freely admits that the boulder clay of Caithness has the
    appearance of true land-ice till, but from the N.W. and S.E. direction
    of the striæ on the rocks, and the presence of sea-shells in the clay,
    he has come to the conclusion that the glaciation of Caithness has been
    effected by floating ice at a time when the district was submerged. I
    have always felt convinced that Mr. Jamieson had not hit upon the true
    explanation of the phenomena.</p>

  <p>(1) It is physically impossible that any deposit formed by icebergs
    could be wholly unstratified. Suppose a mass of the materials which
    would form boulder clay is dropped into the sea from, say an iceberg,
    the heavier parts, such as stones, will reach the bottom first. Then
    will follow lighter materials, such as sand, then clay, and last of all
    the mud will settle down over the whole in fine layers. The different
    masses dropped from the various icebergs, will, no doubt, lie in
    confusion one over the other, but each separate mass will show signs of
    stratification. A good deal of boulder clay evidently has been formed
    in the sea, but if the clay be unstratified, it must have been formed
    under glaciers moving along the sea-bottom as on dry ground. Whether
    <em>unstratified</em> boulder clay may happen to be formed under water or on
    dry land, it must in either case be the product of land-ice.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Those
    who imagine that materials, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>differing in specific gravity like those
    which compose boulder clay, dropped into water, can settle down without
    assuming the stratified form, should make the experiment, and they
    would soon satisfy themselves that the thing is physically impossible.
    The notion that unstratified boulder clay could be formed by deposits
    from floating ice, is not only erroneous, but positively pernicious,
    for it tends to lead those who entertain it astray in regard to the
    whole question of the origin of drift.</p>

  <p>(2) It is also physically impossible that ice-markings, such as those
    everywhere found on the rocky face of the district, and on the pebbles
    and shells imbedded in the clay, could have been effected by any other
    agency than that of land-ice. I need not here enter into any discussion
    on this point, as this has been done at considerable length in another
    place.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In the present case, however, it is unnecessary, because
    if it can be shown that all the facts are accounted for in the most
    natural manner by the theory of land-ice, no one will contend for the
    floating-ice theory; for it is admitted that, with the exception of the
    direction of the striæ and the presence of the shells, all the facts
    agree better with the land-ice than with the floating-ice theory.</p>

  <p>My first impression on the subject was that the glaciation of Caithness
    had been effected by the polar ice-cap, which, during the severer part
    of the glacial epoch, must have extended down to at least the latitude
    of the north of Scotland.</p>

  <p>On a former occasion (see the <cite>Reader</cite> for 14th October, 1865) it was
    shown that all the northern seas, owing to their shallowness, must,
    at that period, have been blocked up with solid ice, which displaced
    the water and moved along the sea-bottoms the same as on dry land. In
    fact, the northern seas, including the German Ocean, being filled at
    the time with glacier-ice, might be regarded as dry land. Ice of this
    sort, moving along the bed of the German Ocean or North Sea, and over
    Caithness, could not fail to push before it the shells and other animal
    remains lying on the sea-bottom, and to mix <span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>them up with the clay
    which now remains upon the land as evidence of its progress.</p>

  <p>About two years ago I had a conversation with Mr. C. W. Peach on the
    subject. This gentleman, as is well known, has long been familiar with
    the boulder clay of Caithness. He felt convinced that the clay of that
    country is the true Lower Till, and not a more recent deposit, as Mr.
    Jamieson supposes. He expressed to me his opinion that the glaciation
    of Caithness had been effected by masses of land-ice crossing the
    Moray Firth from the mountain ranges to the south-east, and passing
    over Caithness in its course. The difficulty which seems to beset
    this theory is, that a glacier entering the Firth would not leave it
    and ascend over the Caithness coast. It would take the path of least
    resistance and move into the North Sea, where it would find a free
    passage into deeper water. Mr. Peach’s theory is, however, an important
    step in the right direction. It is a part of the truth, but I believe
    not the whole truth. The following is submitted as a solution of the
    question.</p>

  <p><em>The Proposed Theory.</em>—It may now be regarded as an established fact
    that, during the severer part of the glacial period, Scotland was
    covered with one continuous mantle of ice, so thick as to bury under
    it the Ochil, Sidlaw, Pentland, Campsie, and other moderately high
    mountain ranges. For example, Mr. J. Geikie and Mr. B. N. Peach found
    that the great masses of the ice from the North-west Highlands, came
    straight over the Ochils of Perthshire and the Lomonds of Fife. In
    fact, these mountain ridges were not sufficiently high to deflect the
    icy stream either to the right hand or to the left; and the flattened
    and rounded tops of the Campsie, Pentland, and Lammermoor ranges bear
    ample testimony to the denuding power of ice.</p>

  <p>Further, to quote from Mr. Jamieson, “the detached mountain of
    Schehallion in Perthshire, 3,500 feet high, is marked near the top as
    well as on its flanks, and this not by ice flowing down the sides of
    the hill itself, but by ice pressing over it from the north. On the top
    of another isolated hill, called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span> Morven, about 3,000 feet high, and
    situated a few miles to the north of the village of Ballater, in the
    county of Aberdeen, I found granite boulders unlike the rock of the
    hill, and apparently derived from the mountains to the west. Again,
    on the highest watersheds of the Ochils, at altitudes of about 2,000
    feet, I found this summer (1864) pieces of mica schist full of garnets,
    which seem to have come from the Grampian Hills to the north-west,
    showing that the transporting agent had overflowed even the highest
    parts of the Ochil ridge. And on the West Lomonds, in Fifeshire, at
    Clattering-well Quarry, 1,450 feet high, I found ice-worn pebbles of
    Red Sandstone and porphyry in the <i lang="fr">débris</i> covering the Carboniferous
    Limestone of the top of the Bishop Hill. Facts like these meet us
    everywhere. Thus on the Perthshire Hills, between Blair Athol and
    Dunkeld, I found ice-worn surfaces of rocks on the tops of hills, at
    elevations of 2,200 feet, as if caused by ice pressing over them from
    the north-west, and transporting boulders at even greater heights.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

  <p>Facts still more important, however, in their bearing on the question
    before us were observed on the Pentland range by Mr. Bennie and myself
    during the summer of 1870. On ascending Allermuir, one of the hills
    forming the northern termination of the Pentland range, we were not a
    little surprised to find its summit ice-worn and striated. The top of
    the hill is composed of a compact porphyritic felstone, which is very
    much broken up; but wherever any remains of the original surface could
    be seen, it was found to be polished and striated in a most decided
    manner. These striæ are all in one uniform direction, nearly east and
    west; and on minutely examining them with a lens we had no difficulty
    whatever in determining that the ice which effected them came from the
    west and not from the east, a fact which clearly shows that they must
    have been made at the time when, as is well known, the entire Midland
    valley was filled with ice, coming from the North-west Highlands. On
    the summit of the hill we also found patches of boulder clay in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>hollow
    basins of the rock. At one spot it was upwards of a foot in depth, and
    rested on the ice-polished surface. The clay was somewhat loose and
    sandy, as might be expected of a layer so thin, exposed to rain, frost,
    and snow, during the long course of ages which must have elapsed since
    it was deposited there. Of 100 pebbles collected from the clay, just as
    they turned up, every one, with the exception of three or four composed
    of hard quartz, presented a flattened and ice-worn surface; and
    forty-four were distinctly striated: in short, every stone which was
    capable of receiving and retaining scratches was striated. A number of
    these stones must have come from the Highlands to the north-west.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

  <p>The height of Allermuir is 1,617 feet, and, from its position, it is
    impossible that the ice could have gone over its summit, unless the
    entire Midland valley, at this place, had been filled with ice to the
    depth of more than 1,600 feet. The hill is situated about four or
    five miles to the south of Edinburgh, and forms, as has already been
    stated, the northern termination of the Pentland range. Immediately
    to the north lies the broad valley of the Firth of Forth, more than
    twelve miles across, offering a most free and unobstructed outlet for
    the great mass of ice coming along the Midland valley from the west.
    Now, when we reflect how easily ice can accommodate itself to the
    inequalities of the channel along which it moves, how it can turn to
    the right hand or to the left, so as to find for itself the path of
    least resistance, it becomes obvious that the ice never would have gone
    over Allermuir, unless not only the Midland valley at this point, but
    also the whole surrounding country had been covered with one continuous
    mass of ice to a depth of more than 1,600 feet. But it must not be
    supposed that the height of Allermuir represents the thickness of the
    ice; for on ascending Scald Law, a hill four miles to the south-west
    of Allermuir, and the highest of the Pentland range, we found, in
    the <i lang="fr">débris</i> covering its summit, hundreds <span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>of transported stones of
    all sizes, from one to eighteen inches in diameter. We also dug up a
    Greenstone boulder about eighteen inches in diameter, which was finely
    polished and striated. As the height of this hill is 1,898 feet, the
    mass of ice covering the surrounding country must have been at least
    1,900 feet deep. But this is not all. Directly to the north of the
    Pentlands, in a line nearly parallel with the east coast, and at right
    angles to the path of ice from the interior, there is not, with the
    exception of the solitary peak of East Lomond, and a low hill or two of
    the Sidlaw range, an eminence worthy of the name of a hill nearer than
    the Grampians in the north of Forfarshire, distant upwards of sixty
    miles. This broad plain, extending from almost the Southern to the
    Northern Highlands, was the great channel through which the ice of the
    interior of Scotland found an outlet into the North Sea. If the depth
    of the ice in the Firth of Forth, which forms the southern side of this
    broad hollow, was at least 1,900 feet, it is not at all probable that
    its depth in the northern side, formed by the Valley of Strathmore
    and the Firth of Tay, which lay more directly in the path of the ice
    from the North Highlands, could have been less. Here we have one vast
    glacier, more than sixty miles broad and 1,900 feet thick, coming from
    the interior of the country.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, evident that the great mass of ice entering the North
    Sea to the east of Scotland, especially about the Firths of Forth
    and Tay, could not have been less, and was probably much more, than
    from 1,000 to 2,000 feet in thickness. The grand question now to be
    considered is, What became of the huge sheet of ice after it entered
    the North Sea? Did it break up and float away as icebergs? This appears
    to have been hitherto taken for granted; but the shallowness of the
    North Sea shows such a process to have been utterly impossible. The
    depth of the sea in the English Channel is only about twenty fathoms,
    and although it gradually increases to about forty fathoms at the
    Moray Firth, yet we must go to the north and west of the Orkney and
    Shetland Islands ere we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span> reach the 100 fathom line. Thus the average
    depth of the entire North Sea is not over forty fathoms, which is even
    insufficient to float an iceberg 300 feet thick.</p>

  <p>No doubt the North Sea, for two reasons, is now much shallower than
    it was during the period in question. (1.) There would, at the time
    of the great extension of the ice on the northern hemisphere, be a
    considerable submergence, resulting from the displacement of the
    earth’s centre of gravity.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> (2.) The sea-bed is now probably
    filled up to a larger extent with drift deposits than it was at the
    ice period. But, after making the most extravagant allowance for the
    additional depth gained on this account, still there could not possibly
    have been water sufficiently deep to float a glacier of 1,000 or 2,000
    feet in thickness. Indeed, the North Sea would have required to be
    nearly ten times deeper than it is at present to have floated the
    ice of the glacial period. We may, therefore, conclude with the most
    perfect certainty that the ice-sheet of Scotland could not possibly
    have broken up into icebergs in such a channel, but must have moved
    along on the bed of the sea in one unbroken mass, and must have found
    its way to the deep trough of the Atlantic, west of the Orkney and
    Shetland Islands, ere it broke up and floated away in the iceberg form.</p>

  <p>It is hardly necessary to remark that the waters of the North Sea would
    have but little effect in melting the ice. A shallow sea like this,
    into which large masses of ice were entering, would be kept constantly
    about the freezing-point, and water of this temperature has but little
    melting power, for it takes 142 lbs. of water, at 33°, to melt one
    pound of ice. In fact, an icy sea tends rather to protect the ice
    entering it from being melted than otherwise. And besides, owing to
    fresh acquisitions of snow, the ice-sheet would be accumulating more
    rapidly upon its upper surface than it would be melting at its lower
    surface, supposing there were sea-water under that surface. The ice of
    Scotland during the glacial period must, of necessity, have found its
    way into warmer water than that of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>the North Sea before it could have
    been melted. But this it could not do without reaching the Atlantic,
    and in getting there it would have to pass round by the Orkney Islands,
    along the bed of the North Sea, as land-ice.</p>

  <p>This will explain how the Orkney Islands may have been glaciated by
    land-ice; but it does not, however, explain how Caithness should have
    been glaciated by that means. These islands lay in the very track of
    the ice on its way to the Atlantic, and could hardly escape being
    overridden; but Caithness lay considerably to the left of the path
    which we should expect the ice to have taken. The ice would not leave
    its channel, turn to the left, and ascend upon Caithness, unless it
    were forced to do so. What, then, compelled the ice to pass over
    Caithness?</p>

  <p><em>Path of the Scandinavian Ice.</em>—We must consider that the ice from
    Scotland and England was but a fraction of that which entered the
    North Sea. The greater part of the ice of Scandinavia must have gone
    into this sea, and if the ice of our island could not find water
    sufficiently deep in which to float, far less would the much thicker
    ice of Scandinavia do so. The Scandinavian ice, before it could break
    up, would thus, like the Scottish ice, have to cross the bed of the
    North Sea and pass into the Atlantic. It could not pass to the north,
    or to the north-west, for the ocean in these directions would be
    blocked up by the polar ice. It is true that along the southern shore
    of Norway there extends a comparatively deep trough of from one to two
    hundred fathoms. But this is evidently not deep enough to have floated
    the Scandinavian ice-sheet; and even supposing it had been sufficiently
    deep, the floating ice must have found its way to the Atlantic, and
    this it could not have done without passing along the coast. Now, its
    passage would not only be obstructed by the mass of ice continually
    protruding into the sea directly at right angles to its course, but it
    would be met by the still more enormous masses of ice coming off the
    entire Norwegian coast-line. And, besides this, the ice entering the
    Arctic Ocean from Lapland and the northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span> parts of Siberia, except
    the very small portion which might find an outlet into the Pacific
    through Behring’s Straits, would have to pass along the Scandinavian
    coast in its way to the Atlantic. No matter, then, what the depth of
    this trough may have been, if the ice from the land, after entering
    it, could not make its escape, it would continue to accumulate till
    the trough became blocked up; and after this, the great mass from the
    land would move forward as though the trough had no existence. Thus,
    the only path for the ice would be by the Orkney and Shetland Islands.
    Its more direct and natural path would, no doubt, be to the south-west,
    in the direction of our shores; and in all probability, had Scotland
    been a low flat island, instead of being a high and mountainous one,
    the ice would have passed completely over it. But its mountainous
    character, and the enormous masses of ice at the time proceeding from
    its interior, would effectually prevent this, so that the ice of
    Scandinavia would be compelled to move round by the Orkney Islands.
    Consequently, these two huge masses of moving ice—the one from Scotland
    and the much greater one from Scandinavia—would meet in the North Sea,
    probably not far from our shores, and would move, as represented in
    the diagram, side by side northwards into the Atlantic as one gigantic
    glacier.</p>

  <p>Nor can this be regarded as an anomalous state of things; for in
    Greenland and the antarctic continent the ice does not break up into
    icebergs on reaching the sea, but moves along the sea-bottom in a
    continuous mass until it reaches water sufficiently deep to float
    it. It is quite possible that the ice at the present day may nowhere
    traverse a distance of three or four hundred miles of sea-bottom, but
    this is wholly owing to the fact that it finds water sufficiently deep
    to float it before having travelled so far. Were Baffin’s Bay and
    Davis’s Straits, for example, as shallow as the North Sea, the ice of
    Greenland would not break up into icebergs in these seas, but cross in
    one continuous mass to and over the American continent.</p>

  <p>The median line of the Scandinavian and Scottish ice-sheets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span> would be
    situated not far from the east coast of Scotland. The Scandinavian ice
    would press up as near to our coast as the resistance of the ice from
    this side permitted. The enormous mass of ice from Scotland, pressing
    out into the North Sea, would compel the Scandinavian ice to move round
    by the Orkneys, and would also keep it at some little distance from
    Scotland. Where, on the other hand, there was but little resistance
    offered by ice from the interior of this country (and this might be the
    case along many parts of the English coast), the Scandinavian ice might
    reach the shores, and even overrun the country for some distance inland.</p>

  <p>We have hitherto confined our attention to the action of ice proceeding
    from Norway; but if we now consider what took place in Sweden and the
    Baltic, we shall find more conclusive proof of the downward pressure
    of Scandinavian ice on our own shores. The western half of Gothland
    is striated in the direction of N.E. and S.W., and that this has been
    effected by a huge mass of ice covering the country, and not by local
    glaciers, is apparent from the fact observed by Robert Chambers,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
    and officers of the Swedish Geological Survey, that the general
    direction of the groovings and striæ on the rocks bears little or no
    relation to the conformation of the surface, showing that the ice was
    of sufficient thickness to move straight forward, regardless of the
    inequalities of the ground.</p>

  <p>At Gottenburg, on the shores of the Cattegat, and all around Lake
    Wener and Lake Wetter, the ice-markings are of the most remarkable
    character, indicating, in the most decided manner, that the ice came
    from the interior of the country to the north-east in one vast mass.
    All this mass of ice must have gone into the shallow Cattegat, a sea
    not sufficiently deep to float even an ordinary glacier. The ice coming
    off Gothland would therefore cross the Cattegat, and thence pass over
    Jutland into the North Sea. After entering the North Sea, it would be
    obliged to keep between our shores and the ice coming direct from the
    western side of Scandinavia.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span></p>

  <p>But this is not all. A very large proportion of the Scandinavian ice
    would pass into the Gulf of Bothnia, where it could not possibly float.
    It would then move south into the Baltic as land-ice. After passing
    down the Baltic, a portion of the ice would probably move south into
    the flat plains in the north of Germany, but the greater portion
    would keep in the bed of the Baltic, and of course turn to the right
    round the south end of Gothland, and thence cross over Denmark into
    the North Sea. That this must have been the path of the ice is, I
    think, obvious from the observations of Murchison, Chambers, Hörbye,
    and other geologists. Sir Roderick Murchison found—though he does not
    attribute it to land-ice—that the Aland Islands, which lie between the
    Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic, are all striated in a north and south
    direction.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

  <p>Upsala and Stockholm, a tract of flat country projecting for some
    distance into the Baltic, is also grooved and striated, not in the
    direction that would be effected by ice coming from the interior of
    Scandinavia, but north and south, in a direction parallel to what must
    have been the course of the ice moving down the Baltic.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> This part
    of the country must have been striated by a mass of ice coming from
    the direction of the Gulf of Bothnia. And that this mass must have
    been great is apparent from the fact that Lake Malar, which crosses
    the country from east to west, at right angles to the path of the ice,
    does not seem to have had any influence in deflecting the icy stream.
    That the ice came from the north and not from the south is also evident
    from the fact that the northern sides of rocky eminences are polished,
    rounded, and ice-worn, while the southern sides are comparatively
    rough. The northern banks of Lake Malar, for example, which, of course,
    face the south, are rough, while the southern banks, which must have
    offered opposition to the advance of the ice, are smoothed and rounded
    in a most singular manner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span></p>

  <p>Again, that the ice, after passing down the Baltic, turned to the
    right along the southern end of Gothland, is shown by the direction
    of the striæ and ice-groovings observed on such islands as Gothland,
    Öland, and Bornholm. Sir R. Murchison found that the island of
    Gothland is grooved and striated in one uniform direction from N.E.
    to S.W. “These groovings,” says Sir Roderick, “so perfectly resemble
    the flutings and striæ produced in the Alps by the actual movement
    of glaciers, that neither M. Agassiz nor any one of his supporters
    could detect a difference.” He concludes, however, that the markings
    could not have been made by land-ice, because Gothland is not only a
    low, flat island in the middle of the Baltic, but is “at least 400
    miles distant from any elevation to which the term of mountain can be
    applied.” This, of course, is conclusive against the hypothesis that
    Gothland and the other islands of the Baltic could have been glaciated
    by ordinary glaciers; but it is quite in harmony with the theory
    that the Gulf of Bothnia and the entire Baltic were filled with one
    continuous mass of land-ice, derived from the drainage of the greater
    part of Sweden, Lapland, and Finland. In fact, the whole glacial
    phenomena of Scandinavia are inexplicable on the hypothesis of local
    glaciers.</p>

  <p>That the Baltic was completely filled by a mass of ice moving from the
    north is further evidenced by the fact that the mainland, not only at
    Upsala, but at several places along the coast of Gothland, is grooved
    and striated parallel to the shore, and often at right angles to the
    markings of the ice from the interior, showing that the present bed of
    the Baltic was not large enough to contain the icy stream. For example,
    along the shores between Kalmar and Karlskrona, as described by Sir
    Roderick Murchison and by M. Hörbye, the striations are parallel to the
    shore. Perhaps the slight obstruction offered by the island of Öland,
    situated so close to the shore, would deflect the edge of the stream at
    this point over on the land. The icy stream, after passing Karlskrona,
    bent round to the west along the present entrance to the Baltic, and
    again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
    invaded the mainland, and crossed over the low headland of
    Christianstadt, and thence passed westward in the direction of Zealand.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This immense Baltic glacier would in all probability pass over Denmark,
    and enter the North Sea somewhere to the north of the River Elbe, and
    would then have to find an outlet to the Atlantic through the English
    Channel, or pass in between our eastern shores and the mass from
    Gothland and the north-western shores of Europe. The entire probable
    path of the ice may be seen by a reference to the accompanying chart
    (<a href="#PLATE_V">Plate V.</a>) That the ice crossed over Denmark is evident from the fact
    that the surface of that country is strewn with <i lang="fr">débris</i> derived from
    the Scandinavian peninsula.</p>

  <p>Taking all these various considerations into account, the conclusion is
    inevitable that the great masses of ice from Scotland would be obliged
    to turn abruptly to the north, as represented in the diagram, and pass
    round into the Atlantic in the direction of Caithness and the Orkney
    Islands.</p>

  <p>If the foregoing be a fair representation of the state of matters,
    it is physically impossible that Caithness could have escaped being
    overridden by the land-ice of the North Sea. Caithness, as is well
    known, is not only a low, flat tract of land, little elevated above the
    sea-level, and consequently incapable of supporting large glaciers;
    but, in addition, it projects in the form of a headland across the
    very path of the ice. Unless Caithness could have protected itself by
    pushing into the sea glaciers of one or two thousand feet in thickness,
    it could not possibly have escaped the inroads of the ice of the
    North Sea. But Caithness itself could not have supported glaciers of
    this magnitude, neither could it have derived them from the adjoining
    mountainous regions of Sutherland, for the ice of this county found a
    more direct outlet than along the flat plains of Caithness.</p>

  <p>The shells which the boulder clay of Caithness contains have thus
    evidently been pushed out of the bed of the North Sea by the land-ice,
    which formed the clay itself.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

  <p>The fact that these shells are not so intensely arctic as those found
    in some other quarters of Scotland, is no evidence that the clay was
    not formed during the most severe part of the glacial epoch, for the
    shells did not live in the North Sea at the time that it was filled
    with land-ice. The shells must have belonged to a period prior to the
    invasion of the ice, and consequently before the cold had reached its
    greatest intensity. Neither is there any necessity for supposing the
    shells to be pre-glacial, for these shells may have belonged to an
    inter-glacial period. In so far as Scotland is concerned, it would be
    hazardous to conclude that a plant or an animal is either pre-glacial
    or post-glacial simply because it may happen not to be of an arctic or
    of a boreal type.</p>

  <p>The same remarks which apply to Caithness apply to a certain extent
    to the headland at Fraserburgh. It, too, lay in the path of the ice,
    and from the direction of the striæ on the rocks, and the presence of
    shells in the clay, as described by Mr. Jamieson, it bears evidence
    also of having been overridden by the land-ice of the North Sea.
    In fact, we have, in the invasion of Caithness and the headland at
    Fraserburgh by the land-ice of the North Sea, a repetition of what we
    have seen took place at Upsala, Kalmar, Christianstadt, and other flat
    tracts along the sides of the Baltic.</p>

  <p>The scarcity, or perhaps entire absence of Scandinavian boulders in
    the Caithness clay is not in any way unfavourable to the theory, for
    it would only be the left edge of the North Sea glacier that could
    possibly pass over Caithness; and this edge, as we have seen, was
    composed of the land-ice from Scotland. We might expect, however, to
    find Scandinavian blocks on the Shetland and Faroe Islands, for, as we
    shall presently see, there is pretty good evidence to prove that the
    Scandinavian ice passed over these islands.</p>

  <p><em>The Shetland and Faroe Islands glaciated by Land-ice.</em>—It is also
    worthy of notice that the striæ on the rocks in the Orkney, Shetland,
    and Faroe Islands, all point in the direction of Scandinavia, and are
    what would be effected by land-ice moving in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span> the paths indicated
    in the diagram. And it is a fact of some significance, that when we
    proceed north to Iceland, the striæ, according to the observations
    of Robert Chambers, seem to point towards North Greenland. Is it
    possible that the entire Atlantic, from Scandinavia to Greenland, was
    filled with land-ice? Astounding as this may at first appear, there
    are several considerations which render such a conclusion probable.
    The observations of Chambers, Peach, Hibbert, Allan, and others, show
    that the rocky face of the Shetland and Faroe Islands has been ground,
    polished, and striated in a most remarkable manner. That this could not
    have been done by ice belonging to the islands themselves is obvious,
    for these islands are much too small to have supported glaciers of any
    size, and the smallest of them is striated as well as the largest.
    Besides, the uniform direction of the striæ on the rocks shows that
    it must have been effected by ice passing over the islands. That the
    striations could not have been effected by floating icebergs at a time
    when the islands were submerged is, I think, equally obvious, from the
    fact that not only are the tops of the highest eminences ice-worn,
    but the entire surface down to the present sea-level is smoothed and
    striated; and these striations conform to all the irregularities of the
    surface. This last fact Professor Geikie has clearly shown is wholly
    irreconcilable with the floating-ice theory.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Mr. Peach<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> found
    vertical precipices in the Shetlands grooved and striated, and the
    same thing was observed by Mr. Thomas Allan on the Faroe Islands.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
    That the whole of these islands have been glaciated by a continuous
    sheet of ice passing over them was the impression left on the mind of
    Robert Chambers after visiting them.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> This is the theory which
    alone explains all the facts. The only difficulty which besets it is
    the enormous thickness of the ice demanded by the theory. But this
    difficulty is very much diminished <span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>when we reflect that we have good
    evidence, from the thickness of icebergs which have been met with
    in the Southern Ocean,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> that the ice moving off the antarctic
    continent must be in some places considerably over a mile in thickness.
    It is then not so surprising that the ice of the glacial epoch, coming
    off Greenland and Northern Europe, should not have been able to float
    in the North Atlantic.</p>

  <p><em>Why the Ice of Scotland was of such enormous Thickness.</em>—The enormous
    thickness of the ice in Scotland, during the glacial epoch, has been
    a matter of no little surprise. It is remarkable how an island, not
    more than 100 miles across, should have been covered with a sheet
    of ice so thick as to bury mountain ranges more than 1,000 feet in
    height, situated almost at the sea-shore. But all our difficulties
    disappear when we reflect that the seas around Scotland, owing to their
    shallowness, were, during the glacial period, blocked up with solid
    ice. Scotland, Scandinavia, and the North Sea, would form one immense
    table-land of ice, from 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the sea-level. This
    table-land would terminate in the deep waters of the Atlantic by a
    perpendicular wall of ice, extending probably from the west of Ireland
    away in the direction of Iceland. From this barrier icebergs would be
    continually breaking off, rivalling in magnitude those which are now to
    be met with in the antarctic seas.</p>

  <p><em>The great Extension of the Loess accounted for.</em>—An effect which would
    result from the blocking up of the North Sea with land-ice, would be
    that the waters of the Rhine, Elbe, and Thames would have to find
    an outlet into the Atlantic through the English Channel. Professor
    Geikie has suggested to me that if the Straits of Dover were not then
    open—quite a possible thing—or were they blocked up with land-ice, say
    by the great Baltic glacier crossing over from Denmark, the consequence
    would be that the waters of the Rhine and Elbe would be dammed back,
    and would inundate all the low-lying tracts of country to the south;
    and this might account for the extraordinary <span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>extension of the Loess in
    the basin of the Rhine, and in Belgium and the north of France.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

  <div class="center"><i>Note on the Glaciation of Caithness.</i></div>

  <p>I have very lately received a remarkable confirmation of the path of
    the Caithness ice in observations communicated to me by Professor
    Geikie and Mr. B. N. Peach. The latter geologist says, “Near the Ord
    of Caithness and on to Berriedale the striæ pass off the land and out
    to sea; but near Dunbeath, 6 miles north-east of Berriedale, they
    begin to creep up out of the sea on to the land and range from about
    15° to 10° east of north. <em>Where the striæ pass out to the sea</em> the
    boulder clay is made up of the materials from inland and contains no
    shells, but <em>immediately the striæ begin to creep up on to the land</em>
    then shells begin to make their appearance; and there is a difference,
    moreover, in the colour of the clay, for in the former case it is
    red and incoherent, and in the latter hard and dark-coloured.” The
    accompanying chart (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate VI.</a>) shows the outline of the Caithness coast
    and the direction of the striæ as observed by Professor Geikie and Mr.
    Peach, and no demonstration could be more conclusive as to the path of
    the ice and the obstacles it met than these observations, supplemented
    and confirmed as they are by other recorded facts to which I shall
    presently allude. Had the ice-current as it entered the North Sea off
    the Sutherland coast met with no obstacle it would have ploughed its
    way outwards till it broke off in glaciers and floated away. But it is
    clear that the great press of Scandinavian ice and the smaller mass of
    land-ice from the Morayshire coast converging in the North Sea filled
    up its entire bed, and these, meeting the opposing current from the
    Sutherland coast, turned it back upon itself, and forced it over the
    north-east <span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>part of Caithness. The farther south on the Sutherland
    coast that the ice entered the sea the deeper would it be able to
    penetrate into the ocean-bed before it met an opposition sufficiently
    strong to turn its course, and the wider would be its sweep; but when
    we come to the Sutherland coast we reach a point where the land-ice—as,
    for example, near Dunbeath—is forced to bend round before it even
    reaches the sea-shore, as will be seen from the accompanying diagram.</p>

  <p>We are led to the same conclusions regarding the path of the ice in the
    North Sea from the presence of oolitic fossils and chalk flints found
    likewise in the boulder clay of Caithness, for these, as we shall see,
    evidently must have come from the sea. At the meeting of the British
    Association, Edinburgh, 1850, Hugh Miller exhibited a collection of
    boreal shells with fragments of oolitic fossils, chalk, and chalk
    flints from the boulder clay of Caithness collected by Mr. Dick, of
    Thurso. My friend, Mr. C. W. Peach, found that the chalk flints in
    the boulder clay of Caithness become more abundant as we proceed
    northward, while the island of Stroma in the Pentland Firth he found
    to be completely strewn with them. This same observer found, also, in
    the Caithness clay stones belonging to the Oolitic and Lias formations,
    with their characteristic fossils, while ammonites, belemnites, fossil
    wood, &amp;c., &amp;c., were also found loose in the clay.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The explanation
    evidently is, that these remains were derived from an outcrop of
    oolitic and cretaceous beds in the North Sea. It is well known that
    the eastern coast of Sutherlandshire is fringed with a narrow strip
    of oolite, which passes under the sea, but to what distance is not
    yet ascertained. Outside the Oolitic formation the chalk beds in all
    probability crop out. It will be seen from a glance at the accompanying
    chart (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate VI.</a>) that the ice which passed over the north-eastern part
    of Caithness must have crossed the out-cropping chalk beds.</p>

  <p>As has already been stated in the foregoing chapter, the headland of
    Fraserburgh, north-eastern corner of Aberdeenshire, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>bears evidence,
    both from the direction of the striæ and broken shells in the boulder
    clay, of having been overridden also by land-ice from the North Sea.
    This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that chalk flints and
    oolitic fossils have also been abundantly met with in the clay by Dr.
    Knight, Mr. James Christie, Mr. W. Ferguson, Mr. T. F. Jamieson, and
    others.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Considerable</span> difficulty has been felt in accounting for the transport
    of the Wastdale granite boulders across the Pennine chain to the east.
    Professors Harkness,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and Phillips,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Messrs. Searles Wood,

    the subject, agree that these blocks could not have been transported
    by land-ice. The agency of floating ice under some form or other is
    assumed by all.</p>

  <p>We have in Scotland phenomena of an exactly similar nature. The summits
    of the Ochils, the Pentlands, and other mountain ranges in the east
    of Scotland, at elevations of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet, are not only
    ice-marked, but strewn over with boulders derived from rocks to the
    west and north-west. Many of them must have come from the Highlands
    distant some 50 or 60 miles. It is impossible that these stones could
    have been transported, or the summits of the hills striated, by means
    of ordinary glaciers. Neither can the phenomena be attributed to the
    agency of icebergs carried along by currents. For we should require to
    assume not merely a submergence of the land <span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>to the extent of 2,000
    feet or so,—an assumption which might be permitted,—but also that the
    currents bearing the icebergs took their rise in the elevated mountains
    of the Highlands (a most unlikely place), and that these currents
    radiated in all directions from that place as a centre.</p>

  <p>In short, the glacial phenomena of Scotland are wholly inexplicable
    upon any other theory than that, during at least a part of the
    glacial epoch, the entire island from sea to sea was covered with one
    continuous mass of ice of not less than 2,000 feet in thickness.</p>

  <p>In my paper on the Boulder Clay of Caithness (see preceding chapter),
    I have shown that if the ice was 2,000 feet or so in thickness, it
    must, in its motion seawards, have followed the paths indicated by the
    curved lines in the chart accompanying that paper (See <a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I.</a>). In
    so far as Scotland is concerned [and Scandinavia also], these lines
    represent pretty accurately not only the paths actually taken by the
    boulders, but also the general direction of the ice-markings on all the
    elevated mountain ridges. But if Scotland was covered to such an extent
    with ice, it is not at all probable that Westmoreland and the other
    mountainous districts of the North of England could have escaped being
    enveloped in a somewhat similar manner. Now if we admit the supposition
    of a continuous mass of ice covering the North of England, all our
    difficulties regarding the transport of the Wastdale blocks across the
    Pennine chain disappear. An inspection of the chart above referred to
    will show that these blocks followed the paths which they ought to have
    done upon the supposition that they were conveyed by continental ice.</p>

  <p>That Wastdale Crag itself suffered abrasion by ice moving over it, in
    the direction indicated by the lines in the diagram, is obvious from
    what has been recorded by Dr. Nicholson and Mr. Mackintosh. They both
    found the Crag itself beautifully <i lang="fr">moutonnée</i> up to its summit, and
    striated in a W.S.W. and E.N.E. direction. Mr. Mackintosh states that
    these scorings run obliquely up the sloping face of the crag. Ice
    scratches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span> crossing valleys and running up the sloping faces of hills
    and over their summits are the sure marks of continental ice, which
    meet the eye everywhere in Scotland. Dr. Nicholson found in the drift
    covering the lower part of the crag, pebbles of the Coniston flags and
    grits from the west.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

  <p>The fact that in Westmoreland the direction of the ice-markings, as a
    general rule, corresponds with the direction of the main valleys, is
    no evidence whatever that the country was not at one period covered
    with a continuous sheet of ice; because, for long ages after the period
    of continental ice, the valleys would be occupied by glaciers, and
    these, of course, would necessarily leave the marks of their presence
    behind. This is just what we have everywhere in Scotland. It is on
    the summits of the hills and elevated ridges, where no glacier could
    possibly reach, that we find the sure evidence of continental ice.
    But that land-ice should have passed over the tops of hills 1,000 or
    2,000 feet in height is a thing hitherto regarded by geologists as
    so unlikely that few of them ever think of searching in such places
    for ice-markings, or for transported stones. Although little has been
    recorded on this point, I hardly think it likely that there is in
    Scotland a hill under 2,000 feet wholly destitute of evidence that ice
    has gone over it. If there were hills in Scotland that should have
    escaped being overridden by ice, they were surely the Pentland Hills;
    but these, as was shown on a former occasion,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> were completely
    buried under the mass of ice covering the flat surrounding country.
    I have no doubt whatever that if the summits of the Pennine range
    were carefully examined, say under the turf, evidence of ice-action,
    in the form of transported stones or scratches on the rock, would be
    found.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>

  <p>Nor is the fact that the Wastdale boulders are not rounded and
    ice-marked, or found in the boulder clay, but lie on the surface, any
    evidence that they were not transported by land-ice. For it would not
    be the stones <em>under</em> the ice, but those falling on the upper surface
    of the sheet, that would stand the best chance of being carried over
    mountain ridges. But such blocks would not be crushed and ice-worn;
    and it is on the surface of the clay, and not imbedded in it, that we
    should expect to find them.</p>

  <p>It is quite possible that the dispersion of the Wastdale boulders took
    place at various periods. During the period of local glaciers the
    blocks would be carried along the line of the valleys.</p>

  <p>All I wish to maintain is that the transport of the blocks across
    the Pennine chain is easily accounted for if we admit, what is very
    probable, that the great ice-covering of Scotland overlapped the high
    grounds of the North of England. The phenomenon is the same in both
    places, and why not attribute it to the same cause?</p>

  <p>There is another curious circumstance connected with the drift of
    England which seems to indicate the agency of an ice-covering.</p>

  <p>As far back as 1819, Dr. Buckland, in his Memoir on the Quartz Rock
    of Lickey Hill,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> directed attention to the fact, that on the
    Cotteswold Hills there are found pebbles of hard red chalk which must
    have come from the Wolds of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. He pointed
    out also that the slaty and porphyritic pebbles probably came from
    Charnwood Forest, near Leicester. Professor Hull, of the Geological
    Survey, considers that “almost all the Northern Drift of this part
    of the country had been derived from the <i lang="fr">débris</i> of the rocks of
    the Midland Counties.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> He came also to the conclusion that the
    slate fragments may have been derived from Charnwood Forest. In <span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>the
    Vale of Moreton he found erratic boulders from two feet to three
    feet in diameter. The same northern character of the drift of this
    district is remarked by Professor Ramsay and Mr. Aveline, in their
    Memoir of the Geology of parts of Gloucestershire. In Leicestershire
    and Northamptonshire the officers of the Geological Survey found in
    abundance drift which must have come from Lincolnshire and Yorkshire to
    the north-east.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lucy, who has also lately directed attention to the fact that
    the Cotteswold Hills are sprinkled over with boulders from Charnwood
    Forest, states also that, on visiting the latter place, he found that
    many of the stones contained in it had come from Yorkshire, still
    further to the north-east.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Searles Wood, jun., in his interesting paper on the Boulder Clay
    of the North of England,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> states that enormous quantities of the
    chalk <i lang="fr">débris</i> from the Yorkshire Wold are found in Leicester, Rutland,
    Warwick, Northampton, and other places to the south and south-west.
    Mr. Wood justly concludes that this chalk <i lang="fr">débris</i> could not have been
    transported by water. “If we consider,” he says, “the soluble nature
    of chalk, it must be evident that none of this débris can have been
    detached from the parent mass, either by water-action, or by any other
    atmospheric agency than moving ice. The action of the sea, of rivers,
    or of the atmosphere, upon chalk, would take the form of dissolution,
    the degraded chalk being taken up in minute quantities by the water,
    and held in suspension by it, and in that form carried away; so that
    it seems obvious that this great volume of rolled chalk can have been
    produced in no other way than by the agency of moving ice; and for that
    agency to have operated to an extent adequate to produce a quantity
    that I estimate as exceeding a layer 200 feet thick over the entire
    Wold, nothing less than the complete envelopment of a large part of the
    Wold by ice for a long period would suffice.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

  <p>I have already assigned my reasons for disbelieving the opinion that
    such masses of drift could have been transported by floating ice; but
    if we refer it to land-ice, it is obvious that the ice could not have
    been in the form of local glaciers, but must have existed as a sheet
    moving in a south and south-west direction, from Yorkshire, across the
    central part of England. But how is this to harmonize with the theory
    of glaciation, which is advanced to explain the transport of the Shap
    boulders?</p>

  <p>The explanation has, I think, been pointed out by a writer in the
    <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> of the 26th November, 1870, in a review of Mr.
    Lucy’s paper.</p>

  <p>In my paper on the Boulder Clay of Caithness, I had represented the ice
    entering the North Sea from the east coast of Scotland and England,
    as all passing round the north of Scotland. But the reviewer suggests
    that the ice entering at places to the south of, say, Flamborough Head,
    would be deflected southwards instead of northwards, and thus pass over
    England. “It is improbable, however,” says the writer, “that this joint
    ice-sheet would, as Mr. Croll supposes, all find its way round the
    north of Scotland into the deep sea. The southern uplands of Scotland,
    and probably also the mountains of Northumberland, propelled, during
    the coldest part of the glacial period, a land ice-sheet in an eastward
    direction. This sheet would be met by another streaming outward from
    the south-western part of Norway—in a diametrically opposite direction.
    In other words, an imaginary line might be drawn representing the
    course of some particular boulder in the <i>moraine profonde</i> from
    England met by a boulder from Norway, in the same straight line. With
    a dense ice-sheet to the north of this line, and an open plain to the
    south, it is clear that all the ice travelling east or west from points
    to the south of the starting-points of our two boulders would be ‘shed’
    off to the south. There would be a point somewhere along the line, at
    which the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>ice would turn as on a pivot—this point being nearer England
    or Scandinavia, as the degree of pressure exercised by the respective
    ice-sheets should determine. There is very little doubt that the point
    in question would be nearer England. Further, the direction of the
    joint ice-sheet could not be <em>due</em> south unless the pressure of the
    component ice-sheets should be exactly equal. In the event of that from
    Scandinavia pressing with greater force, the direction would be to the
    south-west. This is the direction in which the drifts described by Mr.
    Lucy have travelled.”</p>

  <p>I can perceive no physical objection to this modification of the
    theory. What the ice seeks is the path of least resistance, and along
    this path it will move, whether it may lie to the south or to the
    north. And it is not at all improbable that an outlet to the ice would
    be found along the natural hollow formed by the valleys of the Trent,
    Avon, and Severn. Ice moving in this direction would no doubt pass down
    the Bristol Channel and thence into the Atlantic.</p>

  <p>Might not the shedding of the north of England ice-sheet to the north
    and south, somewhere not far from Stainmoor, account for the remarkable
    fact pointed out by Mr. Searles Wood, that the boulder clay, with
    Shap boulders, to the north of the Wold is destitute of chalk; while,
    on the other hand, the chalky boulder clay to the south of the Wold
    is destitute of Shap boulders? The ice which passed over Wastdale
    Crag moved to the E.N.E., and did not cross the chalk of the Wold;
    while the ice which bent round to the south by the Wold came from the
    district lying to the south of Wastdale Crag, and consequently did not
    carry with it any of the granite from that Crag. In fact, Mr. Searles
    Wood has himself represented on the map accompanying his Memoir this
    shedding of the ice north and south.</p>

  <p>These theoretical considerations are, of course, advanced for what
    they are worth. Hitherto geologists have been proceeding upon the
    supposition of an ice-sheet and an open North Sea;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span> but the latter is
    an impossibility. But if we suppose the seas around our island to have
    been filled with land-ice during the glacial epoch, the entire glacial
    problem is changed, and it does not then appear so surprising that ice
    should have passed over England.</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Note on the South of England Ice-sheet.</i></div>

  <p>If what has already been stated regarding the north of England be
    anything like correct, it is evident that the south of England
    could not possibly have escaped glaciation. If the North Sea was so
    completely blocked up by Scandinavian ice, that the great mass of ice
    from the Cumberland mountains entering the sea on the east coast was
    compelled to bend round and find a way of escape across the centre
    of England in the direction of the Bristol Channel, it is scarcely
    possible that the immense mass of ice filling the Baltic Sea and
    crossing over Denmark could help passing across at least a portion
    of the south of England. The North Sea being blocked up, its natural
    outlet into the Atlantic would be through the English Channel; and it
    is not likely that it could pass through without impinging to some
    extent upon the land. Already geologists are beginning to recognise the
    evidence of ice in this region.</p>

  <p>Mr. W. C. Lucy, in the <cite>Geological Magazine</cite> for June, 1874, records
    the finding by himself of evidences of glaciation in West Somerset,
    in the form of “rounded rocky knolls,” near Minehead, like those of
    glaciated districts; of a bed of gravel and clay 70 feet deep, which
    he considered to be boulder clay. He also mentions the occurrence near
    Portlock of a large mass of sandstone well striated, only partially
    detached from the parent rock. In the same magazine for the following
    month Mr. H. B. Woodward records the discovery by Mr. Usher of some
    “rum stuff” near Yarcombe, in the Black Down Hills of Devonshire,
    which, on investigation, proved to be boulder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span> clay; and further, that
    it was not a mere isolated patch, but occurred in several other places
    in the same district. Mr. C. W. Peach informs me that on the Cornwall
    coast, near Dodman Point, at an elevation of about 60 feet above
    sea-level, he found the rock surface well striated and ice-polished.
    In a paper on the Drift Deposits of the Bath district, read before the
    Bath Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club, March 10th, 1874,
    Mr. C. Moore describes the rock surfaces as grooved, with deep and
    long-continued furrows similar to those usually found on glaciated
    rocks, and concludes that during the glacial period they were subjected
    to ice-action. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact of there being
    found, immediately overlying these glaciated rocks, beds of gravel
    with intercalated clay-beds, having a thickness of 30 feet, in which
    mammalian remains of arctic types are abundant. The most characteristic
    of which are <i>Elephas primigenius</i>, <i>E. antiquus</i>, <i>Rhinoceros
    tichorhinus</i>, <i>Bubalus moschatus</i>, and <i>Cervus tarandus</i>.</p>

  <p>There is little doubt that when the ground is better examined many
    other examples will be found. One reason, probably, why so little
    evidence of glaciation in the south of England has been recorded,
    is the comparative absence of rock surfaces suitable for retaining
    ice-markings. There is, however, one class of evidence which might
    determine the question of the glaciation of the south of England as
    satisfactorily as markings on the rock. The evidence to which I refer
    is that of contorted beds of sand or clay. In England contortions from
    the sinking of the beds are, of course, quite common, but a thoughtful
    observer, who has had a little experience of ice-formed contortions,
    can easily, without much trouble, distinguish the latter from the
    former. Contortions resulting from the lateral pressure of the ice
    assume a different form from those produced by the sinking of the beds.
    In Scotland, for example, there is one well-marked form of contortion,
    which not only proves the existence of land-ice, but also the direction
    in which it moved. The form of contortion to which I refer is the
    bending back of the stratified beds upon themselves, somewhat in
    the form of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span> fishing-hook. This form of contortion will be better
    understood from the accompanying figure.</p>

  <p><em>Remarks on the Drift Deposits.</em>—The drift and other surface deposits
    of the country have chiefly been studied from sections observed on the
    banks of streams, railway cuttings, ditches, foundations of buildings,
    and other excavations. The great defect of such sections is that they
    do not lay open a sufficient depth of surface. They may, no doubt,
    represent pretty accurately the character and order of the more recent
    deposits which overlie the boulder clay, but we are hardly warranted
    in concluding that the succession of deposits belonging to the earlier
    part of the glacial epoch, the period of the true till, is fully
    exhibited in such limited sections.</p>

  <p>Suppose, for example, the glacial epoch proper—the time of the lower
    boulder clay—to have consisted of a succession of alternate cold and
    warm periods, there would, in such a case, be a series of separate
    formations of boulder clay; but we could hardly expect to find on the
    flat and open face of the country, where the surface deposits are
    generally not of great depth, those various formations of till lying
    the one superimposed upon the other. For it is obvious that the till
    formed during one ice-period would, as a general rule, be either swept
    away <span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>or re-ground and laid down by the ice of the succeeding period.
    If the very hardest rocks could not withstand the abrading power
    of the enormous masses of ice which passed over the surface of the
    country during the glacial epoch, it is hardly to be expected that the
    comparatively soft boulder clay would be able to do so. It is probable
    that the boulder clay of one period would be used as grinding materials
    by the ice of the succeeding periods. The boulder clay which we find in
    one continuous mass may, therefore, in many cases, have been ground off
    the rocks underneath at widely different periods.</p>

  <p>If we wish to find the boulder clays belonging to each of the
    successive cold periods lying, the one superimposed on the other in
    the order of time in which they were formed, we must go and search in
    some deep gorge or valley, where the clay has not only accumulated
    in enormous masses, but has been partially protected from the
    destructive power of the ice. But it is seldom that the geologist has
    an opportunity of seeing a complete section down to the rock-head in
    such a place. In fact, excepting by bores for minerals, or by shafts
    of pits, the surface, to a depth of one or two hundred feet, is never
    passed through or laid open.</p>

  <p><em>Examination of Drift by Borings.</em>—With the view of ascertaining if
    additional light would be cast on the sequence of events, during the
    formation of the boulder clay, by an examination of the journals of
    bores made through a great depth of surface deposits, a collection
    of about 250 bores, put down in all parts of the mining districts
    of Scotland, was made. An examination of these bores shows most
    conclusively that the opinion that the boulder clay, or lower till, is
    one great undivided formation, is wholly erroneous.</p>

  <p>These 250 bores, as already stated,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> represent a total thickness
    of 21,348 feet, giving 86 feet as the mean thickness of the deposits
    passed through. Twenty of these bores have one boulder clay, with beds
    of stratified sand or gravel beneath the clay; 25 have 2 boulder clays,
    with stratified beds of sand and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>gravel between; 10 have 3 boulder
    clays; one has 4 boulder clays; 2 have 5 boulder clays; and one has no
    fewer than 6 separate masses of boulder clay, with stratified beds of
    sand and gravel between; 16 have two or three separate boulder clays,
    differing altogether in colour and hardness, without any stratified
    beds between. We have, therefore, out of 250 bores, 75 of them
    representing a condition of things wholly different from that exhibited
    to the geologist in ordinary sections.</p>

  <p>These bores bear testimony to the conclusion that the glacial epoch
    consisted of a succession of cold and warm periods, and not of one
    continuous and unbroken period of ice, as was at one time generally
    supposed.</p>

  <p>The full details of the character of the deposits passed through by
    these bores, and their bearing on the history of the glacial epoch,
    have been given by Mr. James Bennie, in an interesting paper read
    before the Glasgow Geological Society,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> to which I would refer
    all those interested in the subject of surface geology. But it is not
    to the mere contents of the bores that I wish at present to direct
    attention, but to a new and important result, to which they have
    unexpectedly led.</p>

  <p><em>Buried River Channel, Kilsyth to Grangemouth, Firth of Forth.</em>—These
    borings reveal the existence of a deep pre-glacial, or perhaps
    inter-glacial, trough or hollow, extending from the Clyde above Bowling
    across the country by Kilsyth, along the valley of the Forth and Clyde
    Canal, to the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth. This trough is filled up
    with immense deposits of mud, sand, gravel, and boulder clay. These
    deposits not only fill it up, but they cover it over to such an extent
    that it is absolutely impossible to find on the surface a single trace
    of it; and had it not been for borings, and other mining operations,
    its existence would probably never have been known. In places where the
    bottom of the trough is perhaps 200 feet below the sea-level, we find
    on the surface not a hollow, but often an immense ridge or elliptical
    knoll of sand, gravel, or boulder clay, rising sometimes to 150 or 200
    feet above the present sea-level.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span></p>

  <p>I need not here enter into any minute details regarding the form,
    depth, and general outline of this trough, or of the character of
    the deposits covering it, these having already been described by Mr.
    Bennie, but shall proceed to the consideration of circumstances which
    seem to throw light on the physical origin of this curious hollow,
    and to the proof which it unexpectedly affords that Scotland, during
    probably an early part of the glacial epoch, stood higher in relation
    to the sea-level than it does at present; or rather, as I would be
    disposed to express it, the sea stood much lower than at present.</p>

  <p>From the fact that all along the line of this trough the surface of the
    country is covered with enormous beds of stratified sands and gravels
    of marine origin, which proves that the sea must have at a recent
    period occupied the valley, my first impression was that this hollow
    had been scooped out by the sea. This conclusion appeared at first
    sight quite natural, for at the time that the sea filled the valley,
    owing to the Gulf-stream impinging on our western shores, a strong
    current would probably then pass through from the Atlantic on the west
    to the German Ocean on the east. However, considerations soon began to
    suggest themselves wholly irreconcilable with this hypothesis.</p>

  <p>The question immediately arose, if the tendency of the sea occupying
    the valley is to deepen it, by wearing down its rocky bottom, and
    removing the abraded materials, then why is the valley filled up to
    such a prodigious extent with marine deposits? Does not the fact of the
    whole valley being filled up from sea to sea with marine deposits to a
    depth of from 100 to 200 feet, and in some places, to even 400 feet,
    show that the tendency of the sea filling this valley is to silt it up
    rather than to deepen it? What conceivable change of conditions could
    account for operations so diverse?</p>

  <p>That the sea could not have cut out this trough, is, however,
    susceptible of direct proof. The height of the surface of the valley
    at the watershed or highest part, about a mile to the east of
    Kilsyth, where the Kelvin and the Bonny Water, running <span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>in opposite
    directions,—the one west into the Clyde, and the other east into the
    Carron,—take their rise, is 160 feet above the sea-level. Consequently,
    before the sea could pass through the valley at present, the sea-level
    would require to be raised 160 feet.</p>

  <p>But in discussing the question as to the origin of this pre-glacial
    hollow, we must suppose the surface deposits of the valley all removed,
    for this hollow was formed before these deposits were laid down. Let
    us take the average depth of these deposits at the watershed to be 50
    feet. It follows that, assuming the hollow in question to have been
    formed by the sea, the sea-level at the time must have been at least
    110 feet higher than at present.</p>

  <p>Were the surface deposits of the country entirely removed, the district
    to the west and north-west of Glasgow would be occupied by a sea
    which would stretch from the Kilpatrick Hills, north of Duntocher,
    to Paisley, a distance of about five miles, and from near Houston to
    within a short way of Kirkintilloch, a distance of more than twelve
    miles. This basin would contain a few small islands and sunken rocks,
    but its mean depth, as determined from a great number of surface bores
    obtained over its whole area, would be not much under 70 or 80 feet.
    But we shall, however, take the depth at only 50 feet. Now, if we raise
    the sea-level so as to allow the water just barely to flow over the
    watershed of the valley, the sea in this basin would therefore be 160
    feet deep. Let us now see what would be the condition of things on the
    east end of the valley. The valley, for several miles to the east of
    Kilsyth, continues very narrow, but on reaching Larbert it suddenly
    opens into the broad and flat carse lands through which the Forth and
    Carron wind. The average depth at which the sea would stand at present
    in this tract of country, were the surface removed, as ascertained from
    bores, would be at least 100 feet, or about double that in the western
    basin. Consequently, when the sea was sufficiently high to pass over
    the watershed, the water would be here 210 feet in depth, and several
    miles in breadth.</p>

      and B represent the buried River Channels.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span></p>

  <p>But in order to have a current of some strength passing through the
    valley, let us suppose the sea at the time to have stood 150 feet
    higher in relation to the land than at present. This would give 40 feet
    as the depth of the sea on the watershed, and 200 feet as the depth in
    the western basin, and 250 feet as the depth in the eastern.</p>

  <p>An examination of the Ordnance Survey map of the district will show
    that the 200 feet contour lines which run along each side of the valley
    from Kilsyth to Castlecary come, in several places, to within one-third
    of a mile of each other. From an inspection of the ground, I found
    that, even though the surface deposits were removed off the valley, it
    would not sensibly affect the contours at those places. It is therefore
    evident that though the sea may have stood even 200 feet higher than at
    present, the breadth of the strait at the watershed and several other
    points could not have exceeded one-third of a mile. It is also evident
    that at those places the current would be flowing with the greatest
    velocity, for here it was not only narrowest, but also shallowest. A
    reference to <a href="#PLATE_VII">Plate VII.</a> will show the form of the basins. The stippled
    portion, coloured blue, represents the area which would be covered by
    the sea were the land submerged to the extent of 200 feet.</p>

  <p>Let us take the breadth of the current in the western basin at, say,
    three miles. This is two miles less than the breadth of the basin
    itself. Suppose the current at the narrow parts between Kilsyth and
    Castlecary to have had a velocity of, say, five miles an hour. Now, as
    the mean velocity of the current at the various parts of its course
    would be inversely proportionate to the sectional areas of those parts,
    it therefore follows that the mean velocity of the current in the
    western basin would be only 1/45th of what it was in the narrow pass
    between Kilsyth and Castlecary. This would give a mile in nine hours
    as the velocity of the water in the western basin. In the eastern
    basin the mean velocity of the current, assuming its breadth to be the
    same as in the western, would be only a mile in eleven hours. In the
    central part of the current the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span> velocity at the surface would probably
    be considerably above the mean, but at the sides and bottom it would,
    no doubt, be under the mean. In fact, in these two basins the current
    would be almost insensible.</p>

  <p>The effect of such a current would simply be to widen and deepen the
    valley all along that part between Kilsyth and Castlecary where the
    current would be flowing with considerable rapidity. But it would
    have little or no effect in deepening the basins at each end, but the
    reverse. It would tend rather to silt them up. If the current flowed
    from west to east, the materials removed from the narrow part between
    Kilsyth and Castlecary, where the velocity of the water was great,
    would be deposited when the current almost disappeared in the eastern
    part of the valley. Sediment carried by a current flowing at the rate
    of five miles an hour, would not remain in suspension when the velocity
    became reduced to less than five miles a day.</p>

  <p>But even supposing it were shown that the sea under such conditions
    could have deepened the valley along the whole distance from the Clyde
    to the Forth, still this would not explain the origin of the trough
    in question. What we are in search of is not the origin of the valley
    itself, but the origin of a deep and narrow hollow running along
    the bottom of it. A sea filling the whole valley, and flowing with
    considerable velocity, would, under certain conditions, no doubt deepen
    and widen it, but it would not cut out along its bottom a deep, narrow
    trough, with sides often steep, and in some places perpendicular and
    even overhanging.</p>

  <p>This hollow is evidently an old river-bed scooped out of the rocky
    valley by a stream, flowing probably during an early part of the
    glacial period.</p>

  <p>During the latter part of the summer of 1868, I spent two or three
    weeks of my holidays in tracing the course of this buried trough from
    Kilsyth to the river Forth at Grangemouth, and I found unmistakable
    evidence that the eastern portion of it, stretching from the watershed
    to the Forth, had been cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span> out, not by the sea, but by a stream which
    must have followed almost the present course of the Bonny Water.</p>

  <p>I found that this deep hollow enters the Forth a few hundred yards to
    the north of Grangemouth Harbour, at the extraordinary depth of 260
    feet below the present sea-level. At the period when the sea occupied
    the valley of the Forth and Clyde Canal, the bottom of the trough at
    this spot would therefore be upwards of 400 feet below the level of the
    sea.</p>

  <p>A short distance to the west of Grangemouth, and also at Carron,
    several bores were put down in lines almost at right angles across
    the trough, and by this means we have been enabled to form a pretty
    accurate estimate of its depth, breadth, and shape at those places. I
    shall give the details of one of those sections.</p>

  <p>Between Towncroft Farm and the river Carron, a bore was put down to
    the depth of 273 feet before the rock was reached. About 150 yards to
    the north of this there is another bore, giving 234 feet as the depth
    to the rock; 150 yards still further north the depth of the surface
    deposits, as determined by a third bore, is 155 feet. This last bore is
    evidently outside of the hollow, for one about 150 yards north of it
    gives the same depth of surface, which seems to be about its average
    depth for a mile or two around. About half a mile to the south of the
    hollow at this place the surface deposits are 150 feet deep. From a
    number of bores obtained at various points within a circuit of 1½
    miles, the surface appears to have a pretty uniform depth of 150 feet
    or thereby. For the particulars of these “bores” I am indebted to the
    kindness of Mr. Mackay, of Grangemouth.</p>

  <p>To the south of the trough (see Fig. 12) there is a fault running
    nearly parallel to it, having a down-throw to the north, and cutting
    off the coal and accompanying strata to the south. But an inspection of
    the section will show that the hollow in question is no way due to the
    fault, but has been scooped out of the solid strata.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="i_474" >
    <div class="caption">Fig. 12.</div>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Section of buried River-bed near Towncroft Farm, Grangemouth.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The main coal wrought extensively here is cut off by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span> trough,
    as will be seen from the section. Mr. Dawson, of Carron Iron Works,
    informs me that at Carronshore pit, about a mile and a quarter above
    where this section is taken, the coal was found to be completely cut
    off by this trough. In one of the workings of this pit, about forty
    years ago, the miners cut into the trough at 40 fathoms below the
    surface, when the sand rushed in with irresistible pressure, and filled
    the working. Again, about a mile below where the section is taken,
    or about two miles below Carronshore, and just at the spot where the
    trough enters the Firth, it was also cut into in one of the workings of
    the Heuck pit at a depth of 40<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span> fathoms from the surface. Fortunately,
    however, at this point the trough is filled with boulder clay instead
    of sand, and no damage was sustained. Here, for a distance of two
    miles, the Main coal and “Upper Coxroad” are cut off by this hollow; or
    rather, I should say this hollow has been cut through the coal-seams.
    The “Under Coxroad,” lying about 14 fathoms below the position of the
    “Main” coal, as will be seen in the descriptive section (Fig. 12), is
    not reached by the trough, and passes undisturbed under it.</p>

  <p>This hollow would seem to narrow considerably as it recedes westwards,
    for at Carronshore pit-shaft the surface is 138 feet deep; but not much
    over 150 yards to the south of this is the spot where the coal was cut
    off by the trough at a depth of 40 fathoms or 240 feet. Here it deepens
    upwards of 100 feet in little more than 150 yards. That it is narrow at
    this place is proved by the fact, that a bore put down near Carronbank,
    a little to the south, shows the surface to be only 156 feet deep.</p>

  <p>In the section (Fig. 12) the line described as “150 <em>feet above
    sea-level</em>” registers the height of the sea-level at the time when
    the central valley was occupied by sea 40 feet deep at the watershed.
    Now, if this hollow, which extends right along the whole length of
    the valley, had been cut out by the sea, the surface of the rock 150
    feet below the present surface of the ground would be the sea-bottom
    at the time, and the line marked “150 <em>feet above sea-level</em>” would be
    the surface of the sea. The sea would therefore be here 300 feet deep
    for several miles around. It cannot be supposed that the sea acting on
    a broad flat plain of several miles in extent should cut out a deep,
    narrow hollow, like the one exhibited in the section, and leave the
    rest of the plain a flat sea-bottom.</p>

  <p>And it must be observed, that this is not a hollow cut merely in a
    sea-beach, but one extending westward to Kilsyth. Now, if this hollow
    was cut out by the sea, it must have been done, not by the waves
    beating on the beach, but by a current flowing through the valley.
    The strongest current that could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span> possibly pass through the narrow
    part between Kilsyth and Castlecary would be wholly insensible when it
    reached Grangemouth, where the water was 300 feet deep, and several
    miles broad. Consequently, it is impossible that the current could have
    scooped out the hollow represented in the section.</p>

  <p>Again, if this hollow had been scooped out by the sea, it ought to
    be deepest between Kilsyth and Castlecary, where the current was
    narrowest; but the reverse is actually the case. It is shallowest at
    the place where the current was narrowest, and deepest at the two
    ends where the current was broadest. In the case of a trough cut by
    a sea current, we must estimate its depth from the level of the sea.
    Its depth is the depth of the water in it while it was being scooped
    out. The bottom of the trough in the highest and narrowest part of
    the valley east of Kilsyth is 40 feet above the present sea-level.
    Consequently, its depth at this point at the period in question, when
    the sea-level was 150 feet higher than at present, would be 110 feet.
    The bottom of the trough at Grangemouth is 260 feet below the present
    sea-level; add to this 150 feet, and we have 410 feet as its depth here
    at the time in question. If this hollow was scooped out by the sea,
    how then does it thus happen that at the place where the current was
    strongest and confined to a narrow channel by hills on each side, it
    cut its channel to a depth of only 110 feet, whereas at the place where
    it had scarcely any motion it has cut, on a flat and open plain several
    miles broad, a channel to a depth of 410 feet?</p>

  <p>But, suppose we estimate the relative amount of work performed by the
    sea at Kilsyth and Grangemouth, not by the actual depth of the bottom
    of the trough at these two places below the sea-level at the time that
    the work was performed, but by the present actual depth of the bottom
    of the trough below the rocky surface of the valley, this will still
    not help us out of the difficulty. Taking, as before, the height of the
    rocky bed of the valley at the watershed at 110 feet above the present
    sea-level, and the bottom of the trough at 40 feet, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span> gives 70 feet
    as the depth scooped out of the rock at that place. The depth of the
    trough at Grangemouth below the rocky surface is 118 feet. Here we have
    only 70 feet cut out at the only place where there was any resistance
    to the current, as well as the place where it possessed any strength;
    whereas at Grangemouth, where there was no resistance, and no strength
    of current, 118 feet has been scooped out. Such a result as this is
    diametrically opposed to all that we know of the dynamics of running
    water.</p>

  <p>We may, therefore, conclude that it is physically impossible that this
    hollow could have been cut out by the sea.</p>

  <p>Owing to the present tendency among geologists to attribute effects
    of this kind to ocean-currents, I have been induced to enter thus at
    much greater length than would otherwise have been necessary into the
    facts and arguments against the possibility of the hollow having been
    excavated by the sea. In the present case the discussion is specially
    necessary, for here we have positive evidence of the sea having
    occupied the valley for ages, along which this channel has been cut.
    Consequently, unless it is proved that the sea could not possibly have
    scooped out the channel, most geologists would be inclined to attribute
    it to the sea-current which is known to have passed through the valley
    rather than to any other cause.</p>

  <p>But that it is a hollow of denudation, and has been scooped out by some
    agent, is perfectly certain. By what agent, then, has the erosion been
    made? The only other cause to which it can possibly be attributed is
    either land-ice or river-action.</p>

  <p>The supposition that this hollow was scooped out by ice is not more
    tenable than the supposition that the work has been done by the sea.
    A glacier filling up the entire valley and descending into the German
    Ocean would unquestionably not only deepen the valley, but would grind
    down the surface over which it passed all along its course. But such a
    glacier would not cut a deep and narrow channel along the bottom of the
    valley. A glacier that could do this would be a small and narrow one,
    just sufficiently large to fill this narrow trough;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span> for if it were
    much broader than the trough, it would grind away its edges, and make a
    broad trough instead of a narrow one. But a glacier so small and narrow
    as only to fill the trough, descending from the hills at Kilsyth to the
    sea at Grangemouth, a distance of fifteen miles, is very improbable
    indeed. The resistance to the advance of the ice along such a slope
    would cause the ice to accumulate till probably the whole valley would
    be filled.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

  <p>There is no other way of explaining the origin of this hollow, but
    upon the supposition of its being an old river-bed. But there is
    certainly nothing surprising in the fact of finding an old watercourse
    under the boulder clay and other deposits. Unless the present contour
    of the country be very different from what it was at the earlier
    part of the glacial epoch, there must have then been watercourses
    corresponding to the Bonny Water and the river Carron of the present
    day; and that the remains of these should be found under the present
    surface deposits is not surprising, seeing that these deposits are of
    such enormous thickness. When water began to flow down our valleys, on
    the disappearance of the ice at the close of the glacial epoch, the
    Carron and the Bonny Water would not be able to regain their old rocky
    channels, but would be obliged to cut, as they have done, new courses
    for themselves on the surface of the deposits under which their old
    ones lay buried.</p>

  <p>Although an old pre-glacial or inter-glacial river-bed is in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>itself an
    object of much interest and curiosity, still, it is not on that account
    that I have been induced to enter so minutely into the details of this
    buried hollow. There is something of far more importance attached to
    this hollow than the mere fact of its being an old watercourse. For the
    fact that it enters the Firth of Forth at a depth of 260 feet below the
    present sea-level, proves incontestably that at the time this hollow
    was occupied by a stream, <em>the land must have stood at least between
    200 and 300 feet higher in relation to the sea-level than at present</em>.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the old surface of the country in the neighbourhood
    of Grangemouth, out of which this ancient stream cut its channel,
    is at least 150 feet below the present sea-level. Now, unless this
    surface had been above the sea-level at that time, the stream would
    not have cut a channel in it. But it has not merely cut a channel, but
    cut one to a depth of 120 feet. It is impossible that this channel
    could have been occupied by a river of sufficient volume to fill it.
    It is not at all likely that the river which scooped it out could have
    been much larger than the Carron of the present day, for the area of
    drainage, from the very formation of the country, could not have been
    much greater above Grangemouth than at present. An elevation of the
    land would, no doubt, increase the area of the drainage of the stream
    measured from its source to where it might then enter the sea, because
    it would increase the length of the stream; but it would neither
    increase the area of drainage, nor the length of the stream above
    Grangemouth. Kilsyth would be the watershed then as it is now.</p>

  <p>What we have here is not the mere channel which had been occupied by
    the ancient Carron, but the valley in which the channel lay. It may,
    perhaps, be more properly termed a buried river valley; formed, no
    doubt, like other river valleys by the denuding action of rain and
    river.</p>

  <p>The river Carron at present is only a few feet deep. Suppose the
    ancient Carron, which flowed in this old channel, to have been say 10
    feet deep. This would show that the land in relation to the sea at that
    time must have stood at least 250 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span> higher than at present. If 10
    feet was the depth of this old river, and Grangemouth the place where
    it entered the sea, then 250 feet would be the extent of the elevation.
    But it is probable that Grangemouth was not the mouth of the river; it
    would likely be merely the place where it joined the river Forth of
    that period. We have every reason to believe that the bed of the German
    Ocean was then dry land, and that the Forth, Tay, Tyne, and other
    British rivers flowing eastward, as Mr. Godwin-Austin supposes, were
    tributaries to the Rhine, which at that time was a huge river passing
    down the bed of the German Ocean, and entering the Atlantic to the west
    of the Orkney Islands. That the German Ocean, as well as the sea-bed of
    the Western Hebrides, was dry land at a very recent geological period,
    is so well known, that, on this point, I need not enter into details.
    We may, therefore, conclude that the river Forth, after passing
    Grangemouth, would continue to descend until it reached the Rhine. If,
    by means of borings, we could trace the old bed of the Forth and the
    Rhine up to the point where the latter entered the Atlantic, in the
    same way as we have done the Bonny Water and the Carron, we should no
    doubt obtain a pretty accurate estimate as to the height at which the
    land stood at that remote period. Nothing whatever, I presume, is known
    as to the depth of the deposits covering the bed of the German Ocean
    along what was then the course of the Rhine. It must, no doubt, be
    something enormous. We are also in ignorance as to the thickness of the
    deposits covering the ancient bed of the Forth. A considerable number
    of bores have been put down at various parts of the Firth of Forth in
    connection with the contemplated railway bridge across the Firth, but
    in none of those bores has the rock been reached. Bores to a depth of
    175 feet have been made without even passing through the deposits of
    silt which probably overlie an enormous thickness of sand and boulder
    clay. Even in places where the water is 40 fathoms deep and quite
    narrow, the bottom is not rock but silt.</p>

  <p>It is, however, satisfactory to find on the land a confirmation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span> of
    what has long been believed from evidence found in the seas around our
    island, that at a very recent period the sea-level in relation to the
    land must have been some hundreds of feet lower than at the present
    day, and that our island must have at that time formed a part of the
    great eastern continent.</p>

  <p>A curious fact was related to me by Mr. Stirling, the manager of the
    Grangemouth collieries, which seems to imply a great elevation of the
    land at a period long posterior to the time when this channel was
    scooped out.</p>

  <p>In sinking a pit at Orchardhead, about a mile to the north of
    Grangemouth, the workmen came upon the boulder clay after passing
    through about 110 feet of sand, clay, and gravel. On the upper surface
    of the boulder clay they found cut out what Mr. Stirling believes
    to have been an old watercourse. It was 17 feet deep, and not much
    broader. The sides of the channel appear to have been smooth and
    water-worn, and the whole was filled with a fine sharp sand beautifully
    stratified. As this channel lay about 100 feet below the present
    sea-level, it shows that if it actually be an old watercourse, it must
    have been scooped out at a time when the land in relation to the sea
    stood at least 100 feet higher than at present.</p>

  <p><em>Buried River Channel from Kilsyth to the Clyde.</em>—In all probability
    the western half of this great hollow, extending from the watershed
    at Kilsyth to the Clyde, is also an old river channel, probably
    the ancient bed of the Kelvin. This point cannot, however, be
    satisfactorily settled until a sufficient number of bores have been
    made along the direct line of the hollow, so as to determine with
    certainty its width and general form and extent. That the western
    channel is as narrow as the eastern is very probable. It has been
    found that its sides at some places, as, for example, at Garscadden,
    are very steep. At one place the north side is actually an overhanging
    buried precipice, the bottom of which is about 200 feet below the
    sea-level. We know also that the coal and ironstone in that quarter are
    cut through by the trough, and the miners there have to exercise great
    caution in driving their workings, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span> case they might cut into it. The
    trough along this district is filled with sand, and is known to the
    miners of the locality as the “sand-dyke.” To cut into running sand at
    a depth of 40 or 50 fathoms is a very dangerous proceeding, as will be
    seen from the details given in Mr. Bennie’s paper<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> of a disaster
    which occurred about twenty years ago to a pit near Duntocher, where
    this trough was cut into at a depth of 51 fathoms from the surface.</p>

  <p>The depth of this hollow, below the present sea-level at Drumry, as
    ascertained by a bore put down, is 230 feet. For several miles to the
    east the depth is nearly as great. Consequently, if this hollow be an
    old river-bed, the ancient river that flowed in it must have entered
    the Clyde at a depth of more than 200 feet below the present sea-level;
    and if so, then it follows that the rocky bed of the ancient Clyde must
    lie buried under more than 200 feet of surface deposits from Bowling
    downwards to the sea. Whether this is the case or not we have no means
    at present of determining. The manager to the Clyde Trustees informs
    me, however, that in none of the borings or excavations which have
    been made has the rock ever been reached from Bowling downwards. The
    probability is, that this deep hollow passes downwards continuously to
    the sea on the western side of the island as on the eastern.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

  <p>The following journals of a few of the borings will give the reader an
    idea of the character of the deposits filling the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>channels. The beds
    which are believed to be boulder clay are printed in italics:—</p>

  <p>The question arises as to what is the origin of the stratified sands
    and gravels filling up the buried river channels. Are they of marine or
    of freshwater origin? Mr. Dugald Bell<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and Mr. James Geikie<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
    are inclined to believe that as far as regards those filling the
    western channel they are of lacustrine origin; that they were formed
    in lakes, produced by the damming back of the water resulting from the
    melting of the ice. I am, however, for the following reasons, inclined
    to agree with Mr. Bennie’s opinion that they are of marine origin.
    It will be seen, by a comparison of the journals of the borings made
    through the deposits in the eastern channel with those in the western,
    that they are of a similar character; so that, if we suppose those in
    the western channel to be of freshwater origin, we may from analogy
    infer the same in reference to the origin of those in the eastern
    channel. But, as we have already seen, the deposits extend to the Firth
    of Forth at Grangemouth, where they are met with at a depth of 260 feet
    below sea-level. Consequently, if we conclude them to be of freshwater
    origin, we are forced to the assumption, not that the water formed by
    the melted ice was dammed back, but that the sea itself was dammed
    back, and that by a wall extending to a depth of not less than two or
    three hundred feet, so as to allow of a lake being formed in which the
    deposits might accumulate; assuming, of course, that the absolute level
    of the land was the same then as it is now.</p>

  <p>But as regards the stratified deposits of Grangemouth, we have direct
    evidence of their marine origin down to the bottom of the Red Clay that
    immediately overlies the till and its intercalated beds, which on an
    average is no less than 85 feet, and in some cases 100 feet, below the
    present surface. From this deposit, Foraminifera, indicating an arctic
    condition of sea, were determined by Mr. David Robertson. Marine shells
    were also found in this bed, and along with them the remains of a
    seal, which was determined by Professor Turner to be of an exceedingly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>arctic type, thus proving that these deposits were not only marine but
    glacial.</p>

  <p>Direct fossil evidence as to the character of the deposits occupying
    the western basin, is, however, not so abundant, but this may be owing
    to the fact that during the sinking of pits, no special attention
    has been paid to the matter. At Blairdardie, in sinking a pit-shaft
    through these deposits, shells were found in a bed of sand between two
    immense masses of boulder clay. The position of this bed will be better
    understood from the following section of the pit-shaft:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">But as the shells were not preserved, we have, of course, no means of
    determining whether they were of marine or of freshwater origin.</p>

  <p>In another pit, at a short distance from the above, <i>Cyprina Islandica</i>
    was found in a bed at the depth of 54 feet below the surface.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

  <p>In a paper read by Mr. James Smith, of Jordanhill, to the Geological
    Society, April 24th, 1850,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> the discovery is recorded of a
    stratified bed containing <i>Tellina proxima</i> intercalated between two
    distinct boulder clays. The bed was discovered by Mr. James Russell in
    sinking a well at Chapelhall, near Airdrie. Its height above sea-level
    was 510 feet. The character of the shell not only proves the marine
    origin of the bed, but also the existence of a submergence to that
    extent during an inter-glacial period.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the difficulty besetting the theory of the marine
    origin of the deposits is this. The intercalated boulder clays bear
    no marks of stratification, and are evidently the true unstratified
    till formed when the country was covered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>by ice. But the fact that
    these beds are both underlaid and overlaid by stratified deposits
    would, on the marine theory, imply not merely the repeated appearance
    and disappearance of the ice, but also the repeated submergence and
    emergence of the land. If the opinion be correct that the submergences
    and emergences of the glacial epoch were due to depressions and
    elevations of the land, and not to oscillations of sea-level, then
    the difficulty in question is, indeed, a formidable one. But, on the
    other hand, if the theory of submergences propounded in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII">XXIII.</a>
    and <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIV">XXIV.</a> be the true one, the difficulty entirely disappears. The
    explanation is as follows, viz., during a cold period of the glacial
    epoch, when the winter solstice was in aphelion, the low grounds would
    be covered with ice, under which a mass of till would be formed.
    After the cold began to decrease, and the ice to disappear from the
    plains, the greatest rise of the ocean, for reasons already stated,
    would take place. The till covering the low grounds would be submerged
    to a considerable depth and would soon be covered over by mud, sand,
    and gravel, carried down by streams from the high ground, which, at
    the time, would still be covered with snow and ice. In course of time
    the sea would begin to sink and a warm and continental period of,
    perhaps, from 6,000 to 10,000 years, would follow, when the sea would
    be standing at a much lower level than at present. The warm period
    would be succeeded by a second cold period, and the ice would again
    cover the land and form a second mass of till, which, in some places,
    would rest directly on the former till, while in other places it would
    be laid down upon the surface of the sands and gravels overlying the
    first mass. Again, on the disappearance of the ice the second mass of
    till would be covered over in like manner by mud, sand, and gravel, and
    so on, while the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit continued at a high
    value. In this way we might have three, four, five, or more masses of
    till separated by beds of sand and gravel.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from <a href="#TABLE_IV">Table IV.</a> of the eccentricity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span> earth’s
    orbit, given in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX.</a>, that the former half of that long
    succession of cold and warm periods, known as the glacial epoch,
    was much more severe than the latter half. That is to say, in the
    former half the accumulation of ice during the cold periods, and its
    disappearance in polar regions during the warm periods, would be
    greater than in the latter half. It was probable that it was during
    the warm periods of the earlier part of the glacial epoch that the two
    buried channels of the Midland valley were occupied by rivers, and that
    it was during the latter and less severe part of the glacial epoch that
    these channels became filled up with that remarkable series of deposits
    which we have been considering.</p>

  <p><em>Other buried River Channels.</em>—A good many examples of buried river
    channels have been found both in Scotland and in England, though none
    of them of so remarkable a character as the two occupying the valley
    of the Forth and Clyde Canal which have been just described. I may,
    however, briefly refer to one or two localities where some of these
    occur.</p>

  <p>(1.) An ancient buried river channel, similar to the one extending
    from Kilsyth to Grangemouth, exists in the coal-fields of Durham,
    and is known to miners in the district as the “Wash.” Its course was
    traced by Mr. Nicholas Wood, F.G.S., and Mr. E. F. Boyd, from Durham
    to Newcastle, a distance of fourteen miles.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> It traverses, after
    passing the city of Durham, a portion of the valley of the Wear, passes
    Chester-le-Street, and then follows the valley of the river Team, and
    terminates at the river Tyne. And what is remarkable, it enters the
    Tyne at a depth of 140 feet below the present level of the sea. This
    curious hollow lies buried, like the Scottish one just alluded to,
    under an enormous mass of drift, and it is only through means of boring
    and other mining operations that its character has been revealed. The
    bottom and sides of this channel everywhere bear evidence of long
    exposure to the abrading influence of water in motion; the rocky bottom
    being smoothed, furrowed, and water-worn. The river Wear of the present
    day flows to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>the sea over the surface of the drift at an elevation of
    more than 100 feet above this buried river-bed. At the time that this
    channel was occupied by running water the sea-level must have been at
    least 140 feet lower than at present. This old river evidently belongs
    to the same continental period as those of Scotland.</p>

  <p>(2.) From extensive borings and excavations, made at the docks of Hull
    and Grimsby, it is found that the ancient bed of the Humber is buried
    under more than 100 feet of silt, clay, and gravel. At Hull the bottom
    of this buried trough was found to be 110 feet below the sea-level.
    And what is most interesting at both these places, the remains of a
    submerged forest was found at a depth of from thirty to fifty feet
    below the sea-level. In some places two forests were found divided by a
    bed of leafy clay from five to fifteen feet thick.</p>

  <p>(3.) In the valleys of Norfolk we also find the same conditions
    exhibited. The ancient bed of the Yare and other rivers of this
    district enter the sea at a depth of more than 100 feet below the
    present sea-level. At Yarmouth the surface was found 170 feet thick,
    and the deep surface extends along the Yare to beyond Norwich. Buried
    forests are also found here similar to those on the Humber.</p>

  <p>It is probable that all our British rivers flow into the sea over their
    old buried channels, except in cases where they may have changed their
    courses since the beginning of the glacial epoch.</p>

  <p>(4.) In the Sanquhar Coal Basin, at the foot of the Kello Water, an
    old buried river course was found by Mr. B. N. Peach. It ran at right
    angles to the Kello, and was filled with boulder clay which cut off the
    coal; but, on driving the mine through the clay, the coal was found in
    position on the other side.</p>

  <p>(5.) An old river course, under the boulder clay, is described by Mr.
    Milne Home in his memoir on the Mid-Lothian coal-fields. It has been
    traced out from Niddry away in a N.E. direction by New Craighall. At
    Niddry, the hollow is about 100 yards wide and between 60 and 70 feet
    deep. It seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span> deepen and widen as it approaches towards the sea,
    for at New Craighall it is about 200 yards wide and 97 feet deep. This
    old channel will probably enter the sea about Musselburgh. Like the
    channels in the Midland Valley of Scotland already described, it is so
    completely filled up by drift that not a trace of it is to be seen on
    the surface. And like these, also, it must have belonged to a period
    when the sea-level stood much lower than at present.</p>

  <p>(6.) At Hailes’ Quarry, near Edinburgh, there is to be seen a portion
    of an ancient watercourse under the boulder drift. A short account
    of it was given by Dr. Page in a paper read before the Edinburgh
    Geological Society.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The superincumbent sandstone, he says, has
    been cut to a depth of 60 feet. The width of the channel at the surface
    varies from 12 to 14 feet, but gradually narrows to 2 or 3 feet at the
    bottom. The sides and bottom are smoothed and polished, and the whole
    is now filled with till and boulders.</p>

  <p>(7.) One of the most remarkable buried channels is that along the
    Valley of Strathmore, supposed to be the ancient bed of the Tay. It
    extends from Dunkeld, the south of Blairgowrie, Ruthven, and Forfar,
    and enters the German Ocean at Lunan Bay. Its length is about 34 miles.</p>

  <p>“No great river,” says Sir Charles Lyell, “follows this course, but
    it is marked everywhere by lakes or ponds, which afford shell-marl,
    swamps, and peat moss, commonly surrounded by ridges of detritus from
    50 to 70 feet high, consisting in the lower part of till and boulders,
    and in the upper of stratified gravels, sand, loam, and clay, in some
    instances curved or contorted.”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

  <p>“It evidently marks an ancient line, by which, first, a great glacier
    descended from the mountains to the sea, and by which, secondly, at
    a later period, the principal water drainage of this country was
    effected.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span></p>

  <p>(8.) A number of examples of ancient river courses, underneath the
    boulder clay, are detailed by Professor Geikie in his glacial drift of
    Scotland. Some of the cases described by him have acquired additional
    interest from the fact of their bearing decided testimony to the
    existence of inter-glacial warm periods. I shall briefly refer to a few
    of the cases described by him.</p>

  <p>In driving a trial mine in a pit at Chapelhall, near Airdrie, the
    workmen came upon what they believed to be an old river course. At
    the end of the trial mine the ironstone, with its accompanying coal
    and fire-clay, were cut off at an angle of about 20° by a stiff,
    dark-coloured earth, stuck full of angular pieces of white sandstone,
    coal, and shale, with rounded pebbles of greenstone, basalt, quartz,
    &amp;c. Above this lay a fine series of sand and clay beds. Above these
    stratified beds lay a depth of 50 or 60 feet of true boulder clay. The
    channel ran in the direction of north-east and south-west. Mr. Russell,
    of Chapelhall, informs Professor Geikie that another of the same kind,
    a mile farther to the north-west, had been traced in some of the pit
    workings.</p>

  <p>“It is clear,” says Professor Geikie, “that whatever may be the true
    explanation of these channels and basins, they unquestionably belong to
    the period of the boulder clay. The Chapelhall basin lies, indeed, in a
    hollow of the carboniferous rocks, but its stratified sands and clays
    rest on an irregular floor of true till. The old channel near the banks
    of the Calder is likewise scooped out of sandstones and shales; but
    it has a coating of boulder clay, on which its finely-laminated sands
    and clays repose, <em>as if the channel itself had once been filled with
    boulder clay, which was re-excavated to allow of the deposition of the
    stratified deposits. In all cases, a thick mantle of coarse, tumultuous
    boulder clay buries the whole.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

  <p>Professor Geikie found between the mouth of the Pease Burn and St.
    Abb’s Head, Berwickshire, several ancient buried channels. One at
    the Menzie Cleuch, near Redheugh Shore, was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>filled to the brim with
    boulder clay. Another, the Lumsden Dean, half a mile to the east of
    Fast Castle, on the bank of the Carmichael Burn, near the parish church
    of Carmichael,—an old watercourse of the boulder clay period—is to
    be seen. The valley of the Mouse Water he instances as a remarkable
    example.</p>

  <p>One or two he found in Ayrshire, and also one on the banks of the Lyne
    Water, a tributary of the Tweed.</p>

  <p>(9.) In the valley of the Clyde, above Hamilton, several buried river
    channels have been observed. They are thus described by Mr. James
    Geikie:—<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

  <p>“In the Wishaw district, two deep, winding troughs, filled with sand
    and fine gravel, have been traced over a considerable area in the coal
    workings.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> These troughs form no feature at the surface, but are
    entirely concealed below a thick covering of boulder clay. They appear
    to be old stream courses, and are in all probability the pre-glacial
    ravines of the Calder Water and the Tillon Burn. The ‘sand-dyke’ that
    represents the pre-glacial course of the Calder Water runs for some
    distance parallel to the present course of the stream down to Wishaw
    House, where it is intersected by the Calder, and the deposits which
    choke it up are well seen in the steep wooded banks below the house
    and in the cliff on the opposite side. It next strikes to south-east,
    and is again well exposed on the road-side leading down from Wishaw
    to the Calder Water. From this point it has been traced underground,
    more or less continuously, as far as Wishaw Ironworks. Beyond this
    place the coal-seams sink to a greater depth, and therefore cease to
    be intersected by the ancient ravine, the course of which, however,
    may still be inferred from the evidence obtained during the sinking
    of shafts and trial borings. In all probability it runs south, and
    enters the old course of the Clyde a little below Cambusnethan House.
    Only a portion of the old ravine <span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>of the Tillon Burn is shown upon the
    Map. It is first met with in the coal-workings of Cleland Townhead
    (Sheet 31). From this place it winds underground in a southerly
    direction until it is intersected by the present Tillon Burn, a little
    north of Glencleland (Sheet 31). It now runs to south-west, keeping
    parallel to the burn, and crosses the valley of the Calder just
    immediately above the mouth of the Tillon. From this point it can be
    traced in pit-shafts, open-air sections, borings, and coal-workings,
    by Ravenscraig, Nether Johnstone, and Robberhall Belting, on to the
    Calder Water below Coursington Bridge (Sheet 31). It would thus appear
    that in pre-glacial times the Calder and the Tillon were independent
    streams, and that since glacial times the Calder Water, forsaking its
    pre-glacial course, has cut its way across the intervening ground,
    ploughing out deep ravines in the solid rocks, until eventually it
    united with the Tillon. Similar buried stream courses occur at other
    places. Thus, at Fairholme, near Larkhall, as already mentioned (par.
    94), the pre-glacial course of the Avon has been traced in pit-shafts
    and borings for some distance to the north. Another old course, filled
    up with boulder clay, is exposed in a burn near Plotcock, a mile
    south-west from Millheugh; and a similar pre-glacial ravine was met
    with in the cement-stone workings at Calderwood.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Indeed, it might
    be said with truth that nearly all the rocky ravines through which the
    waters flow, especially in the carboniferous areas, are of post-glacial
    age—the pre-glacial courses lying concealed under masses of drift. Most
    frequently, however, the present courses of the streams are partly
    pre-glacial and partly post-glacial. In the pre-glacial portions the
    streams flow through boulder clay, in the post-glacial reaches their
    course, as just mentioned, is usually in rocky ravines. The Avon and
    the Calder, with their tributaries, afford numerous illustrations of
    these phenomena.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span></p>

  <p>The question naturally arises, When were those channels scooped out?
    To what geological period must those ancient rivers be referred? It
    will not do to conclude that those channels must be pre-glacial simply
    because they contain boulder clay. Had the glacial epoch been one
    unbroken period of cold, and the boulder clay one continuous formation,
    then the fact of finding boulder clay in those channels would show that
    they were pre-glacial. But when we find undoubted geological evidence
    of a warm condition of climate of long continuance, during the severest
    part of the glacial epoch, when the ice, to a great extent, must have
    disappeared, and water began to flow as usual down our valleys, all
    that can reasonably be inferred from the fact of finding till in those
    channels, is that they must be older than the till they contain. We
    cannot infer that they are older than all the till lying on the face
    of the country. The probability, however, is, that some of them are
    of pre-glacial and others of inter-glacial origin. That many of these
    channels have been used as watercourses during the glacial epoch, or
    rather during warm periods of that epoch, is certain, from the fact
    that they have been filled with boulder clay, then re-excavated, and
    finally filled up again with the clay.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> cause of the motion of glaciers has proved to be one of the most
    difficult and perplexing questions within the whole domain of physics.
    The main difficulty lies in reconciling the motion of the glacier with
    the physical properties of the ice. A glacier moves down a valley
    very much in the same way as a river, the motion being least at the
    sides and greatest at the centre, and greater at the surface than at
    the bottom. In a cross section scarcely two particles will be moving
    with the same velocity. Again, a glacier accommodates itself to the
    inequalities of the channel in which it moves exactly as a semifluid
    or plastic substance would do. So thoroughly does a glacier behave
    in the manner of a viscous or plastic body that Professor Forbes was
    induced to believe that viscosity was a property of the ice, and that
    in virtue of this property it was enabled to move with a differential
    motion and accommodate itself to all the inequalities of its channel
    without losing its continuity just as a mass of mud or putty would do.
    But experience proves that ice is a hard and brittle substance far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
    more resembling glass than putty. In fact it is one of the most brittle
    and unyielding substances in nature. So unyielding is a glacier that
    it will snap in two before it will stretch to any perceptible extent.
    This is proved by the fact that crevasses resulting from a strain on
    the glacier consist at first of a simple crack scarcely wide enough to
    admit the blade of a penknife.</p>

  <p>All the effects which were considered to be due to the viscosity of
    the ice have been fully explained and accounted for on the principle
    of fracture and regelation discovered by Faraday. The principle of
    regelation explains why the ice moving with a differential motion and
    accommodating itself to the inequalities of its channel is yet enabled
    to retain its continuity, but it does not account for the <em>cause</em> of
    glacier motion. In fact it rather involves the question in deeper
    mystery than before. For it is far more difficult to conceive how the
    particles of a hard and brittle solid like that of ice can move with
    a differential motion, than it is to conceive how this may take place
    in the case of a soft and yielding substance. The particles of ice
    have all to be displaced one over another and alongside each other,
    and as those particles are rigidly fixed together this connection must
    be broken before the one can slide over the other. <em>Shearing-force</em>,
    as Canon Moseley shows, comes into play. Were ice a plastic substance
    there would not be much difficulty in understanding how the particles
    should move the one over the other, but it is totally different when
    we conceive ice to be a solid and unyielding substance. The difficulty
    in connection with glacier-motion is not to account for the continuity
    of the ice, for the principle of regelation fully explains this, but
    to show how it is that one particle succeeds in sliding over the over.
    The principle of regelation, instead of assisting to remove this
    difficulty, increases it tenfold. Regelation does not explain the cause
    of glacier-motion, but the reverse. It rather tends to show that a
    glacier should not move. What, then, is the cause of glacier-motion?
    According to the regelation theory, gravitation is the impelling
    cause.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span> But is gravitation sufficient to <em>shear</em> the ice in the manner
    in which it is actually done in a glacier?</p>

  <p>I presume that few who have given much thought to the subject of
    glacier-motion have not had some slight misgivings in regard to the
    commonly received theory. There are some facts which I never could
    harmonize with this theory. For example, boulder clay is a far looser
    substance than ice; its shearing-force must be very much less than
    that of ice; yet immense masses of boulder clay will lie immovable for
    ages on the slope of a hill so steep that one can hardly venture to
    climb it, while a glacier will come crawling down a valley which by
    the eye we could hardly detect to be actually off the level. Again, a
    glacier moves faster during the day than during the night, and about
    twice as fast during summer as during winter. Professor Forbes, for
    example, found that the Glacier des Bois near its lower extremity moved
    sometimes in December only 11·5 inches daily, while during the month
    of July its rate of motion sometimes reached 52·1 inches per day. Why
    such a difference in the rate of motion between day and night, summer
    and winter? The glacier is not heavier during the day than it is
    during the night, or during the summer than it is during the winter;
    neither is the shearing-force of the great mass of the ice of a glacier
    sensibly less during day than night, or during summer than winter;
    for the temperature of the great mass of the ice does not sensibly
    vary with the seasons. If this be the case, then gravitation ought to
    be as able to shear the ice during the night as during the day, or
    during the winter as during the summer. At any rate, if there should
    be any difference it ought to be but trifling. It is true that, owing
    to the melting of the ice, the crevices of the glacier are more gorged
    with water during summer than winter; and this, as Professor Forbes
    maintains,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> may tend to make the glacier move faster during the
    former than the latter season. But the advocates of the regelation
    theory cannot conclude, with Professor Forbes, that the water favours
    the motion of the glacier <span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>by making the ice more soft and plastic. The
    melting of the ice, according to the regelation theory, cannot very
    materially aid the motion of the glacier.</p>

  <p>The theory which has led to the general belief that the ice of a
    glacier is sheared by the force of gravity appears to be the following.
    It is supposed that the only forces to which the motion of a glacier
    can be referred are <em>gravitation</em> and <em>heat</em>; but as the great mass
    of a glacier remains constantly at the same uniform temperature it
    is concluded to be impossible that the motion of the glacier can be
    due to this cause, and therefore of course it must be attributed to
    gravitation, there being no other cause.</p>

  <p>That gravitation is insufficient to shear the ice of a glacier has been
    clearly demonstrated by Canon Moseley.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> He determined by experiment
    the amount of force required to shear one square inch of ice, and found
    it to be about 75 lbs. By a process of calculation which will be found
    detailed in the Memoir referred to, he demonstrated that to descend
    by its own weight at the rate at which Professor Tyndall observed the
    ice of the Mer de Glace to be descending at the Tacul, the unit of
    shearing force of the ice could not have been more than 1·31931 lbs.
    Consequently it will require a force more than 34 times the weight of
    the glacier to shear the ice and cause it to descend in the manner in
    which it is found to descend.</p>

  <p>It is now six years since Canon Moseley’s results were laid before the
    public, and no one, as far as I am aware, has yet attempted to point
    out any serious defect in his mathematical treatment of the question.
    Seeing the great amount of interest manifested in the question of
    glacier-motion, I think we are warranted to conclude that had the
    mathematical part of the memoir been inconclusive its defects would
    have been pointed out ere this time. The question, then, hinges on
    whether the experimental data on which his calculations are based
    be correct. Or, in other words, is the unit of shear of ice as much
    as 75 lbs.? This part of Mr. Moseley’s researches has not passed
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>unquestioned. Mr. Ball and Mr. Mathews, both of whom have had much
    experience among glaciers, and have bestowed considerable attention on
    the subject of glacier-motion, have objected to the accuracy of Mr.
    Moseley’s unit of shear. I have carefully read the interesting memoirs
    of Mr. Mathews and Mr. Ball in reply to Canon Moseley, but I am unable
    to perceive that anything which they have advanced materially affects
    his general conclusions as regards the commonly received theory. Mr.
    Mathews objects to Canon Moseley’s experiments on the grounds that
    extraneous forces are brought to bear upon the substance submitted
    to operation, and that conditions are thus introduced which do not
    obtain in the case of an actual glacier. “It would throw,” he says,
    “great light upon our inquiry if we were to change this method of
    procedure and simply to observe the deportment of masses of ice under
    the influence of no external forces but the gravitation of their own
    particles.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> A plank of ice six inches wide and 2⅜ inches in
    thickness was supported at each end by bearers six feet apart. From the
    moment the plank was placed in position it began to sink, and continued
    to do so until it touched the surface over which it was supported. Mr.
    Mathews remarks that with this property of ice, viz., its power to
    change its form under strains produced by its own gravitation, combined
    with the sliding movement demonstrated by Hopkins, we have an adequate
    cause for glacier-motion. Mr. Mathews concludes from this experiment
    that the unit of shear in ice, instead of being 75 lbs., is less than
    1¾ lbs.</p>

  <p>There is, however, no parallel between the bending of the ice-plank and
    the shearing of a glacier. Mr. Mathews’ experiment appears to prove too
    much, as will be seen from the following reply of Canon Moseley:—</p>

  <p>“Now I will,” he says, “suggest to Mr. Mathews a parallel experiment
    and a parallel explanation. If a bar of wrought iron 1 inch square and
    20 feet long were supported at its extremities, it would <em>bend</em> by its
    weight alone, and would therefore <span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>shear. Now the weight of such a
    rod would be about 67 lbs. According to Mr. Mathews’s explanation in
    the case of the ice-plank, the unit of shear in wrought-iron should
    therefore be 67 lbs. per square inch. It is actually 50,000 lbs.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

  <p>Whatever theory we may adopt as to the cause of the motion of glaciers,
    the deflection of the plank in the way described by Mr. Mathews
    <em>follows as a necessary consequence</em>. Although no weight was placed
    upon the plank, it does not necessarily follow that the deflection
    was caused by the weight of the ice alone; for, according to Canon
    Moseley’s own theory of the motion of glaciers by heat, the plank
    ought to be deflected in the middle, just as it was in Mr. Mathews’s
    experiment. A solid body, when exposed to variations of temperature,
    will expand and contract transversely as well as longitudinally. Ice,
    according to Canon Moseley’s theory, expands and contracts by heat.
    Then if the plank expands transversely, the upper half of the plank
    must rise and the lower half descend. But the side which rises has
    to perform work against gravity, whereas the side which descends has
    work performed upon it by gravity; consequently more of the plank will
    descend than rise, and this will, of course, tend to lower or deflect
    the plank in the middle. Again, when the plank contracts, the lower
    half will rise and the upper half will descend; but as gravitation,
    in this case also, favours the descending part and opposes the rising
    part, more of the plank will descend than rise, and consequently
    the plank will be lowered in the middle by contraction as well as
    by expansion. Thus, as the plank changes its temperature, it must,
    according to Mr. Moseley’s theory, descend or be deflected in the
    middle, step by step—and this not by gravitation alone, but chiefly
    by the motive power of heat. I do not, of course, mean to assert that
    the descent of the plank was caused by heat; but I assert that Mr.
    Mathews’s experiment does not necessarily prove (and this is all that
    is required in the meantime) that gravitation alone was the cause of
    the deflection of the plank. Neither does this experiment prove that
    the ice was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>deflected without shearing; for although the weight of the
    plank was not sufficient to shear the ice, as Mr. Mathews, I presume,
    admits, yet Mr. Moseley would reply that the weight of the ice,
    assisted by the motive power of heat, was perfectly sufficient.</p>

  <p>I shall now briefly refer to Mr. Ball’s principal objections to Canon
    Moseley’s proof that a glacier cannot shear by its weight alone. One
    of his chief objections is that Mr. Moseley has assumed the ice to be
    homogeneous in structure, and that pressures and tensions acting within
    it, are not modified by the varying constitution of the mass.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
    Although there is, no doubt, some force in this objection (for we have
    probably good reason to believe that ice will shear, for example, more
    easily along certain planes than others), still I can hardly think that
    Canon Moseley’s main conclusion can ever be materially affected by this
    objection. The main question is this, Can the ice of the glacier shear
    by its own weight in the way generally supposed? Now the shearing force
    of ice, take it in whatever direction we may, so enormously exceeds
    that required by Mr. Moseley in order to allow a glacier to descend by
    its weight only, that it is a matter of indifference whether ice be
    regarded as homogeneous in structure or not. Mr. Ball objects also to
    Mr. Moseley’s imaginary glacier lying on an even slope and in a uniform
    rectangular channel. He thinks that an irregular channel and a variable
    slope would be more favourable to the descent of the ice. But surely
    if the work by the weight of the ice be not equal to the work by the
    resistance in a glacier of uniform breadth and slope, it must be much
    less so in the case of one of irregular shape and slope.</p>

  <p>That a relative displacement of the particles of the ice is involved
    in the motion of a glacier, is admitted, of course, by Mr. Ball; but
    he states that the amount of this displacement is but small, and that
    it is effected with extreme slowness. This may be the case; but if the
    weight of the ice be not able to overcome the mutual cohesion of the
    particles, then the weight <span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>of the ice cannot produce the required
    displacement, however small it may be. Mr. Ball then objects to Mr.
    Moseley’s method of determining the unit of shear on this ground:—The
    shearing of the ice in a glacier is effected with extreme slowness;
    but the shearing in Canon Moseley’s experiment was effected with
    rapidity; and although it required 75 lbs. to shear one square inch of
    surface in his experiment, it does not follow that 75 lbs. would be
    required to shear the ice if done in the slow manner in which it is
    effected in the glacier. “In short,” says Mr. Ball, “to ascertain the
    resistance opposed to very slow changes in the relative positions of
    the particles, so slight as to be insensible at short distances, Mr.
    Moseley measures the resistance opposed to rapid disruption between
    contiguous portions of the same substance.”</p>

  <p>There is force in this objection; and here we arrive at a really weak
    point in Canon Moseley’s reasoning. His experiments show that if we
    want to shear ice quickly a weight of nearly 120 lbs. is required; but
    if the thing is to be done more slowly, 75 lbs. will suffice.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> In
    short, the number of pounds required to shear the ice depends, to a
    large extent, on the length of time that the weight is allowed to act;
    the longer it is allowed to act, the less will be the weight required
    to perform the work. “I am curious to know,” says Mr. Mathews, when
    referring to this point, “what weight would have sheared the ice
    if a <em>day</em> had been allowed for its operation.” I do not know what
    would have been the weight required to shear the ice in Mr. Moseley’s
    experiments had a day been allowed; but I feel pretty confident that,
    should the ice remain unmelted, and sufficient time be allowed,
    shearing would be produced without the application of any weight
    whatever. There are no weights placed upon a glacier to make it move,
    and yet the ice of the glacier shears. If the shearing is effected by
    weight, the only weight applied is the weight of the ice; and if the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>weight of the ice makes the ice shear in the glacier, why may it not
    do the same thing in the experiment? Whatever may be the cause which
    displaces the particles of the ice in a glacier, they, as a matter of
    fact, are displaced without any weight being applied beyond that of
    the ice itself; and if so, why may not the particles of the ice in
    the experiment be also displaced without the application of weights?
    Allow the ice of the glacier to take its own time and its own way, and
    the particles will move over each other without the aid of external
    weights, whatever may be the cause of this; well, then, allow the ice
    in the experiment to take its own time and its own way, and it will
    probably do the same thing. There is something here unsatisfactory.
    If, by the unit of shear, be meant the pressure in pounds that must
    be applied to the ice to break the connection of one square inch of
    two surfaces frozen together and cause the one to slip over the other,
    then the amount of pressure required to do this will depend upon the
    time you allow for the thing being done. If the thing is to be done
    rapidly, as in some of Mr. Moseley’s experiments, it will take, as he
    has shown, a pressure of about 120 lbs.; but if the thing has to be
    done more slowly, as in some other of his experiments, 75 lbs. will
    suffice. And if sufficient time be allowed, as in the case of glaciers,
    the thing may be done without any weight whatever being applied to the
    ice, and, of course, Mr. Moseley’s argument, that a glacier cannot
    descend by its weight alone, falls to the ground. But if, by the unit
    of shear, be meant not the <em>weight</em> or <em>pressure</em> necessary to shear
    the ice, but the amount of <em>work</em> required to shear a square inch of
    surface <em>in a given time or at a given rate</em>, then he might be able
    to show that in the case of a glacier (say the Mer de Glace) the work
    of all the resistances which are opposed to its descent at the <em>rate</em>
    at which it is descending is greater than the work of its weight, and
    that consequently there must be some cause, in addition to the weight,
    urging the glacier forward. But then he would have no right to affirm
    that the glacier would not descend by its weight only; all that he
    could affirm would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span> simply be that it could not descend by its weight
    alone at the <em>rate</em> at which it is descending.</p>

  <p>Mr. Moseley’s unit of shear, however, is not the amount of work
    performed in shearing a square inch of ice in a given time, but the
    amount of <em>weight</em> or <em>pressure</em> requiring to be applied to the ice
    to shear a square inch. But this amount of pressure depends upon the
    length of time that the pressure is applied. Here lies the difficulty
    in determining what amount of pressure is to be taken as the real unit.
    And here also lies the radical defect in Canon Moseley’s result. Time
    as well as pressure enters as an element into the process. The key to
    the explanation of this curious circumstance will, I think, be found in
    the fact that the rate at which a glacier descends depends in some way
    or other upon the amount of heat that the ice is receiving. This fact
    shows that heat has something to do in the shearing of the ice of the
    glacier. But in the communication of heat to the ice <em>time</em> necessarily
    enters as an element. There are two different ways in which heat may be
    conceived to aid in shearing the ice: (1.) we may conceive that heat
    acts as a force along with gravitation in producing displacement of the
    particles of the ice; or (2.) we may conceive that heat does not act as
    a force in pushing the particles over each other, but that it assists
    the shearing processes by diminishing the cohesion of the particles of
    the ice, and thus allowing gravitation to produce displacement. The
    former is the function attributed to heat in Canon Moseley’s theory
    of glacier-motion; the latter is the function attributed to heat in
    the theory of glacier-motion which I ventured to advance some time
    ago.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> It results, therefore, from Canon Moseley’s own theory, that
    the longer the time that is allowed for the pressure to shear the
    ice, the less will be the pressure required; for, according to his
    theory, a very large proportion of the displacement is produced by the
    motive power of heat entering the ice; and, as it follows of course,
    other things being equal, the longer the time during which the heat
    is allowed to act, the greater will be the proportionate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>amount of
    displacement produced by the heat; consequently the less will require
    to be done by the weight applied. In the case of the glacier, Mr.
    Moseley concludes that at least thirty or forty times as much work is
    done by the motive power of heat in the way of shearing the ice as is
    done by mere pressure or weight. Then, if sufficient time be allowed,
    why may not far more be done by heat in shearing the ice in his
    experiment than by the weight applied? In this case how is he to know
    how much of the shearing is effected by the heat and how much by the
    weight? If the greater part of the shearing of the ice in the case of a
    glacier is produced, not by pressure, but by the heat which necessarily
    enters the ice, it would be inconceivable that in his experiments the
    heat entering the ice should not produce, at least to some extent, a
    similar effect. And if a portion of the displacement of the particles
    is produced by heat, then the weight which is applied cannot be
    regarded as the measure of the force employed in the displacement, any
    more than it could be inferred that the weight of the glacier is the
    measure of the force employed in the shearing of it. If the weight
    is not the entire force employed in shearing, but only a part of the
    force, then the weight cannot, as in Mr. Moseley’s experiment, be taken
    as the measure of the force.</p>

  <p>How, then, are we to determine what is the amount of force required to
    shear ice? in other words, how is the unit of shear to be determined?
    If we are to measure the unit of shear by the weight required to
    produce displacement of the particles of the ice, we must make sure
    that the displacement is wholly effected by the weight. We must be
    certain that heat does not enter as an element in the process. But
    if time be allowed to elapse during the experiment, we can never
    be certain that heat has not been at work. It is impossible to
    prevent heat entering the ice. We may keep the ice at a constant
    temperature, but this would not prevent heat from entering the ice and
    producing molecular work. True that, according to Moseley’s theory
    of glacier-motion, if the temperature of the ice be not permitted
    to <em>vary</em>, then no displacement of the particles can take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
    from the influence of heat; but according to the molecular theory of
    glacier-motion, which will shortly be considered, heat will aid the
    displacement of the particles whether the temperature be kept constant
    or not. In short, it is absolutely impossible in our experiments to
    be certain that heat is not in some way or other concerned in the
    displacement of the particles of the ice. But we can shorten the time,
    and thus make sure that the amount of heat entering the ice during the
    experiments is too small to affect materially the result. We cannot in
    this case say that all the displacement has been effected by the weight
    applied to the ice, but we can say that so little has been done by heat
    that, practically, we may regard it as all done by the weight.</p>

  <p>This consideration, I trust, shows that the unit of shear adopted by
    Canon Moseley in his calculations is not too large. For if in half an
    hour, after all the work that may have been done by heat, a pressure of
    75 lbs. is still required to displace the particles of one square inch,
    it is perfectly evident that if no work had been done by heat during
    that time, the force required to produce the displacement could not
    have been less than 75 lbs. It might have been more than that; but it
    could not have been less. Be this, however, as it may, in determining
    the unit of shear we cannot be permitted to prolong the experiment for
    any considerable length of time, because the weight under which the
    ice might then shear could not be taken as the measure of the force
    which is required to shear ice. By prolonging the experiment we might
    possibly get a unit smaller than that required by Canon Moseley for
    a glacier to descend by its own weight. But it would be just as much
    begging the whole question at issue to assume that, because the ice
    sheared under such a weight, a glacier might descend by its weight
    alone, as it would be to assume that, because a glacier shears without
    a weight being placed upon it, the glacier descends by its weight alone.</p>

  <p>But why not determine the unit of shear of ice in the same way as we
    would the unit of shear of any other solid substance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span> such, as iron,
    stone, or wood? If the shearing force of ice be determined in this
    manner, it will be found to be by far too great to allow of the ice
    shearing by its weight alone. We shall be obliged to admit either
    that the ice of the glacier does not shear (in the ordinary sense of
    the term), or if it does shear, that there must, as Canon Moseley
    concludes, be some other force in addition to the weight of the ice
    urging the glacier forward.</p>

  <p>The fact that the rate of descent of a glacier depends upon the amount
    of heat which it receives, proves that heat must be regarded either as
    a cause or as a necessary condition of its motion; what, then, is the
    necessary relationship between heat and the motion of the glacier? If
    heat is to be regarded as a cause, in what way does the heat produce
    motion? I shall now briefly refer to one or two theories which have
    been advanced on the subject. Let us consider first that of Canon
    Moseley.</p>

  <p><em>Canon Moseley’s Theory.</em>—He found, from observations and experiments,
    that sheets of lead, placed upon an inclined plane, when subjected to
    variations of temperature, tend to descend even when the slope is far
    less than that which would enable it to slide down under the influence
    of gravitation. The cause of the descent he shows to be this. When the
    temperature of the sheet is raised, it expands, and, in expanding, its
    upper portion moves up the slope, and its lower portion down the slope;
    but as gravitation opposes the upward and favours the downward motion,
    more of the sheet moves down than up, and consequently the centre
    of gravity of the sheet is slightly lowered. Again, when the sheet
    is cooled, it contracts, and in contracting the upper portion moves
    downwards and the lower portion upwards, and here again, for the same
    reason, more of the sheet moves downwards than upwards. Consequently,
    at every change of temperature there is a slight displacement of the
    sheet downwards. “Now a theory of the descent of glaciers,” says
    Canon Moseley, “which I have ventured to propose myself, is that they
    descend, as the lead in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span> experiment does, by reason of the passage
    into them and the withdrawal of the sun’s rays, and that the dilatation
    and contraction of the ice so produced is the proximate cause of their
    descent, as it is of that of the lead.”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

  <p>The fundamental condition in Mr. Moseley’s theory of the descent of
    solid bodies on an incline, is, not that heat should maintain these
    bodies at a high temperature, but that the temperature should vary.
    The rate of descent is proportionate, not simply to the amount of
    heat received, but to the extent and frequency of the variations of
    temperature. As a proof that glaciers are subjected to great variations
    of temperature, he adduces the following:—“All alpine travellers,” he
    says, “from De Saussure to Forbes and Tyndall, have borne testimony
    to the intensity of the solar radiation on the surfaces of glaciers.
    ‘I scarcely ever,’ says Forbes, ‘remember to have found the sun more
    piercing than at the Jardin.’ This heat passes abruptly into a state
    of intense cold when any part of the glacier falls into shadow by an
    alteration of the position of the sun, or even by the passing over it
    of a cloud.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Moseley is here narrating simply what the traveller feels, and
    not what the glacier experiences. The traveller is subjected to great
    variations of temperature; but there is no proof from this that the
    glacier experiences any changes of temperature. It is rather because
    the temperature of the glacier is not affected by the sun’s heat that
    the traveller is so much chilled when the sun’s rays are cut off. The
    sun shines down with piercing rays and the traveller is scorched; the
    glacier melts on the surface, but it still remains “cold as ice.” The
    sun passes behind a cloud or disappears behind a neighbouring hill; the
    scorching rays are then withdrawn, and the traveller is now subjected
    to radiation on every side from surfaces at the freezing-point.</p>

  <p>It is also a necessary condition in Mr. Moseley’s theory that the heat
    should pass easily into and out of the glacier; for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>unless this were
    the case sudden changes of temperature could produce little or no
    effect on the great mass of the glacier. How, then, is it possible that
    during the heat of summer the temperature of the glacier could vary
    much? During that season, in the lower valleys at least, everything,
    with the exception of the glacier, is above the freezing-point;
    consequently when the glacier goes into the shade there is nothing
    to lower the ice below the freezing-point; and as the sun’s rays do
    not raise the temperature of the ice above the freezing-point, the
    temperature of the glacier must therefore remain unaltered during that
    season. It therefore follows that, instead of a glacier moving more
    rapidly during the middle of summer than during the middle of winter,
    it should, according to Moseley’s theory, have no motion whatever
    during summer.</p>

  <p>The following, written fifteen years ago by Professor Forbes on this
    very point, is most conclusive:—“But how stands the fact? Mr. Moseley
    quotes from De Saussure the following <em>daily ranges</em> of the temperature
    of the air in the month of July at the Col du Géant and at Chamouni,
    between which points the glacier lies:</p>

  <table summary="Daily temperature ranges">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th class="tdl">&nbsp; &nbsp; °</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>At the Col du Géant</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 4·257 Réaumur.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>At Chamouni</td>
        <td>10·092&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 〃</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p class="noindent">And he assumes ‘the same mean daily variation of temperature to obtain
    throughout the length’ [and depth?] ‘of the Glacier du Géant which De
    Saussure observed in July at the Col du Géant.’ But between what limits
    does the temperature of the air oscillate? We find, by referring to the
    third volume of De Saussure’s ‘Travels,’ that the mean temperature of
    the coldest hour (4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>) during his stay at the Col du Géant
    was 33°·03 Fahrenheit, and of the warmest (2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>) 42°·61 F.
    So that even upon that exposed ridge, between 2,000 and 3,000 feet
    above where the glacier can be properly said to commence, the air does
    not, on an average of the month of July, reach the freezing-point
    at any hour of the night. Consequently the <em>range of temperature
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>attributed to the glacier is between limits absolutely incapable of
    effecting the expansion of the ice in the smallest degree</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

  <p>Again, during winter, as Mr. Ball remarks, the glacier is completely
    covered with snow and thus protected both from the influence of
    cold and of heat, so that there can be nothing either to raise the
    temperature of the ice above the freezing-point or to bring it below
    that point; and consequently the glacier ought to remain immovable
    during that season also.</p>

  <p>“There can be no doubt, therefore,” Mr. Moseley states, “that the
    rays of the sun, which in those alpine regions are of such remarkable
    intensity, find their way into the depths of the glacier. They are
    a <em>power</em>, and there is no such thing as the loss of power. The
    mechanical work which is their equivalent, and into which they are
    converted when received into the substance of a solid body, accumulates
    and stores itself up in the ice under the form of what we call
    elastic force or tendency to dilate, until it becomes sufficient to
    produce actual dilatation of the ice in the direction in which the
    resistance is weakest, and by its withdrawal to produce contraction.
    From this expansion and contraction follows of necessity the descent
    of the glacier.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> When the temperature of the ice is below
    the freezing-point, the rays which are absorbed will, no doubt,
    produce dilatation; but during summer, when the ice is not below the
    freezing-point, no dilatation can possibly take place. All physicists,
    so far as I am aware, agree that the rays that are then absorbed go to
    melt the ice, and not to expand it. But to this Mr. Moseley replied
    as follows:—“To this there is the obvious answer that radiant heat
    does find its way into ice as a matter of common observation, and
    that it does not melt it except at its surface. Blocks of ice may be
    seen in the windows of ice-shops with the sun shining full upon them,
    and melting nowhere but on their surfaces. And the experiment of the
    ice-lens shows that heat may stream through ice in abundance (of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>which
    a portion is necessarily stopped in the passage) without melting it,
    except on its surface.” But what evidence is there to conclude that
    if there is no melting of the ice in the interior of the lens there
    is a portion of the rays “necessarily stopped” in the interior? It
    will not do to assume a point so much opposed to all that we know of
    the physical properties of ice as this really is. It is absolutely
    essential to Mr. Moseley’s theory of the motion of glaciers, during
    summer at least, that ice should continue to expand after it reaches
    the melting-point; and it has therefore to be shown that such is the
    case; or it need not be wondered at that we cannot accept his theory,
    because it demands the adoption of a conclusion contrary to all our
    previous conceptions. But, as a matter of fact, it is not strictly true
    that when rays pass through a piece of ice there is no melting of the
    ice in the interior. Experiments made by Professor Tyndall show the
    contrary.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

  <p>There is, however, one fortunate circumstance connected with Canon
    Moseley’s theory. It is this: its truth can be easily tested by direct
    experiment. The ice, according to this theory, descends not simply
    in virtue of heat, but in virtue of <em>change of temperature</em>. Try,
    then, Hopkins’s famous experiment, but keep the ice at a <em>constant
    temperature</em>; then, according to Moseley’s theory, the ice will not
    descend. Let it be observed, however, that although the ice under this
    condition should descend (as there is little doubt but it would),
    it would show that Mr. Moseley’s theory of the descent of glaciers
    is incorrect, still it would not in the least degree affect the
    conclusions which he lately arrived at in regard to the generally
    received theory of glacier-motion. It would not prove that the ice
    sheared, in the way generally supposed, by its weight only. It might be
    the heat, after all, entering the ice, which accounted for its descent,
    although gravitation (the weight of the ice) might be the impelling
    cause.</p>

  <p>According to this theory, the glacier, like the sheet of lead, must
    expand and contract as one entire mass, and it is difficult <span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>to
    conceive how this could account for the differential motion of the
    particles of the ice.</p>

  <p><em>Professor James Thomson’s Theory.</em>—It was discovered by this physicist
    that the freezing-point of water is lowered by pressure. The extent
    of the lowering is equal to ·0075° centigrade for every atmosphere
    of pressure. As glacier ice is generally about the melting-point,
    it follows that when enormous pressure is brought to bear upon any
    given point of a glacier a melting of the ice at that particular spot
    will take place in consequence of the lowering of the melting-point.
    The melting of the ice will, of course, tend to favour the descent
    of the glacier, but I can hardly think the liquefaction produced by
    pressure can account for the motion of glaciers. It will help to
    explain the giving way of the ice at particular points subjected to
    great pressure, but I am unable to comprehend how it can account for
    the general descent of the glacier. Conceive a rectangular glacier of
    uniform breadth and thickness, and lying upon an even slope. In such a
    glacier the pressure at each particular point would remain constant,
    for there would be no reason why it should be greater at one time than
    at another. Suppose the glacier to be 500 feet in thickness; the ice
    at the lower surface of the glacier, owing to pressure, would have its
    melting-point permanently lowered one-tenth of a degree centigrade
    below that of the upper surface; but the ice at the lower surface would
    not, on this account, be in the fluid state. It would simply be ice at
    a slightly lower temperature. True, when pressure is exerted the ice
    melts in consequence of the lowering of the melting-point, but in the
    case under consideration there would, properly speaking, be no exertion
    of pressure, but a constant statical pressure resulting from the weight
    of the ice. But this statical condition of pressure would not produce
    fluidity any more than a statical condition of pressure would produce
    heat, and consequently motion could not take place as a result of
    fluidity. In short, motion itself is required to produce the fluidity.</p>

  <p>I need not here wait to consider the sliding theories of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span> De Saussure
    and Hopkins, as they are now almost universally admitted to be
    inadequate to explain the phenomena of glacier-motion, seeing that they
    do not account for the displacement of the particles of the ice over
    one another.</p>

  <p>According to the dilatation theory of M. Charpentier, a glacier is
    impelled by the force exerted by water freezing in the fissures of the
    ice. A glacier he considers is full of fissures into which water is
    being constantly infiltrated, and when the temperature of the air sinks
    below the freezing-point it converts the water into ice. The water, in
    passing into ice, expands, and in expanding tends to impel the glacier
    in the direction of least resistance. This theory, although it does not
    explain glacier-motion, as has been clearly shown by Professor J. D.
    Forbes, nevertheless contains one important element which, as we shall
    see, must enter into the true explanation. The element to which I refer
    is the expansive force exerted on the glacier by water freezing.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> condition which the perplexing question of the cause of the descent
    of glaciers has now reached seems to be something like the following.
    The ice of a glacier is not in a soft and plastic state, but is solid,
    hard, brittle, and unyielding. It nevertheless behaves in some respects
    in a manner very like what a soft and plastic substance would do if
    placed in similar circumstances, inasmuch as it accommodates itself
    to all the inequalities of the channel in which it moves. The ice of
    the glacier, though hard and solid, moves with a differential motion;
    the particles of the ice are displaced over each other, or, in other
    words, the ice shears as it descends. It had been concluded that the
    mere weight of the glacier is sufficient to shear the ice. Canon
    Moseley has investigated this point, and shown that it is not. He has
    found that for a glacier to shear in the way that it is supposed to
    do, it would require a force some thirty or forty times as great as
    the weight of the glacier. Consequently, for the glacier to descend,
    a force in addition to that of gravitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span> is required. What, then,
    is this force? It is found that the rate at which the glacier descends
    depends upon the amount of heat which it is receiving. This shows that
    the motion of the glacier is in some way or other dependent upon heat.
    Is heat, then, the force we are in search of? The answer to this, of
    course, is, since heat is a force necessarily required, we have no
    right to assume any other till we see whether or not heat will suffice.
    In what way, then, does heat aid gravitation in the descent of the
    glacier? In what way does heat assist gravitation in the shearing of
    the ice? There are two ways whereby we may conceive the thing to be
    done: the heat may assist gravitation to shear, by pressing the ice
    forward, or it may assist gravitation by diminishing the cohesion of
    the particles, and thus allow gravitation to produce motion which it
    otherwise could not produce. Every attempt which has yet been made
    to explain how heat can act as a force in pushing the ice forward,
    has failed. The fact that heat cannot expand the ice of the glacier
    may be regarded as a sufficient proof that it does not act as a force
    impelling the glacier forward; and we are thus obliged to turn our
    attention to the other conception, viz., that heat assists gravitation
    to shear the ice, not by direct pressure, but by diminishing the
    cohesive force of the particles, so as to enable gravitation to push
    the one past the other. But how is this done? Does heat diminish the
    cohesion by acting as an expansive force in separating the particles?
    Heat cannot do this, because it cannot expand the ice of a glacier;
    and besides, were it to do this, it would destroy the solid and firm
    character of the ice, and the ice of the glacier would not then, as
    a mass, possess the great amount of shearing-force which observation
    and experiment show that it does. In short it is because the particles
    are so firmly fixed together at the time the glacier is descending,
    that we are obliged to call in the aid of some other force in addition
    to the weight of the glacier to shear the ice. Heat does not cause
    displacement of the particles by making the ice soft and plastic; for
    we know that the ice of the glacier is not soft and plastic, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
    hard and brittle. The shearing-force of the ice of the moving glacier
    is found to be by at least from thirty to forty times too great to
    permit of the ice being sheared by the mere force of gravitation;
    how, then, is it that gravitation, without the direct assistance of
    any other force, can manage to shear the ice? Or to put the question
    under another form: heat does not reduce the shearing-force of the ice
    of a glacier to something like 1·3193 lb. per square inch of surface,
    the unit required by Mr. Moseley to enable a glacier to shear by
    its weight; the shearing-force of the ice, notwithstanding all the
    heat received, still remains at about 75 lbs.; how, then, can the
    glacier shear without any other force than its own weight pushing it
    forward? <em>This is the fundamental question; and the true answer to it
    must reveal the mystery of glacier-motion.</em> We are compelled in the
    present state of the problem to admit that glaciers do descend with
    a differential motion without any other force than their own weight
    pushing them forward; and yet the shearing-force of the ice is actually
    found to be thirty or forty times the maximum that would permit of the
    glacier shearing by its weight only. <em>The explanation of this apparent
    paradox will remove all our difficulties in reference to the cause of
    the descent of glaciers.</em></p>

  <p>There seems to be but one explanation (and it is a very obvious
    one), viz. that the motion of the glacier is <em>molecular</em>. The ice
    descends molecule by molecule. The ice of a glacier is in the hard
    crystalline state, but it does not descend in this state. Gravitation
    is a constantly acting force; if a particle of the ice lose its
    shearing-force, though but for the moment, it will descend by its
    weight alone. But a particle of the ice will lose its shearing-force
    for a moment if the particle loses its crystalline state for the
    moment. The passage of heat through ice, whether by conduction or by
    radiation, in all probability is a molecular process; that is, the
    form of energy termed heat is transmitted from molecule to molecule
    of the ice. A particle takes the energy from its neighbour A on the
    one side and hands it over to its neighbour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span> B on the opposite side.
    But the particle must be in a different state at the moment it is in
    possession of the energy from what it was before it received it from
    A, and from what it will be after it has handed it over to B. Before
    it became possessed of the energy, it was in the crystalline state—it
    was ice; and after it loses possession of the energy it will be ice;
    but at the moment that it is in possession of the passing energy is
    it in the crystalline or icy state? If we assume that it is not, but
    that in becoming possessed of the energy, it loses its crystalline form
    and for the moment becomes water, all our difficulties regarding the
    cause of the motion of glaciers are removed. We know that the ice of a
    glacier in the mass cannot become possessed of energy in the form of
    heat without becoming fluid; <em>if it can be shown that the same thing
    holds true of the ice particle, we have the key to the mystery of
    glacier-motion</em>. A moment’s reflection will suffice to convince any one
    that if the glacier ice in the mass cannot receive energy in the form
    of heat without melting, the same must hold true of the ice particles,
    for it is inconceivable that the ice in the mass could melt and yet
    the ice particles themselves remain in the solid state. It is the
    solidity of the particles which constitutes the solidity of the mass.
    If the particles lose their solid form the mass loses its solid form,
    for the mass has no other solidity than that which is possessed by the
    particles.</p>

  <p>The correctness of the conclusion, that the weight of the ice is
    not a sufficient cause, depends upon the truth of a certain element
    taken for granted in the reasoning, viz. that the <em>shearing-force</em> of
    the molecules of the ice remains <em>constant</em>. If this force remains
    constant, then Canon Moseley’s conclusion is undoubtedly correct,
    but not otherwise; for if a molecule should lose its shearing-force,
    though it were but for a moment, if no obstacle stood in front of the
    molecule, it would descend in virtue of its weight.</p>

  <p>The fact that the shearing-force of a mass of ice is found to be
    constant does not prove that the same is the case in regard to the
    individual molecules. If we take a mass of molecules in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span> the aggregate,
    the shearing-force of the mass taken thus collectively may remain
    absolutely constant, while at the same time each individual molecule
    may be suffering repeated momentary losses of shearing-force. This is
    so obvious as to require no further elucidation. The whole matter,
    therefore, resolves itself into this one question, as to whether or not
    the shearing-force of a crystalline molecule of ice remains constant.
    In the case of ordinary solid bodies we have no reason to conclude that
    the shearing-force of the molecules ever disappears, but in regard to
    ice it is very different.</p>

  <p>If we analyze the process by which heat is conducted through ice, we
    shall find that we have reason to believe <em>that while a molecule of
    ice is in the act of transmitting the energy received (say from a
    fire), it loses for the moment its shearing-force if the temperature of
    the ice be not under</em> 32° F. If we apply heat to the end of a bar of
    iron, the molecules at the surface of the end have their temperatures
    raised. Molecule A at the surface, whose temperature has been raised,
    instantly commences to transfer to B a portion of the energy received.
    The tendency of this process is to lower the temperature of A and raise
    that of B. B then, with its temperature raised, begins to transfer
    the energy to C. The result here is the same; B tends to fall in
    temperature, and C to rise. This process goes on from molecule to
    molecule until the opposite end of the bar is reached. Here in this
    case the energy or heat applied to the end of the bar is transmitted
    from molecule to molecule under the form of <em>heat or temperature</em>.
    The energy applied to the bar does <em>not change its character; it
    passes right along from molecule to molecule under the form of heat or
    temperature</em>. But the nature of the process must be wholly different if
    the transferrence takes place through a bar of ice at the temperature
    of 32°. Suppose we apply the heat of the fire to the end of the bar
    of ice at 32°, the molecules of the ice cannot possibly have their
    temperatures raised in the least degree. How, then, can molecule A
    take on, <em>under the form of heat</em>, the energy received from the fire
    without being heated or having its <em>temperature</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span> raised? The thing is
    impossible. The energy of the fire must appear in A under a different
    form from that of heat. The same process of reasoning is equally
    applicable to B. The molecule B cannot accept of the energy from A
    under the form of heat; it must receive it under some other form. The
    same must hold equally true of all the other molecules till we reach
    the opposite end of the bar of ice. And yet, strange to say, the last
    molecule transmits in the form of heat its energy to the objects
    beyond; for we find that the heat applied to one side of a piece of ice
    will affect the thermal pile on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>The question is susceptible of a clear and definite answer. When
    heat is applied to a molecule of ice at 32°, the heat applied
    does not raise the temperature of the molecule, it is consumed in
    work against the cohesive forces binding the atoms or particles
    together into the crystalline form. The energy then must exist in
    the dissolved crystalline molecule, under the statical form of an
    affinity—crystalline affinity, or whatever else we may call it. That is
    to say, the energy then exists in the particles as a power or tendency
    to rush together again into the crystalline form, and the moment they
    are allowed to do so they give out the energy that was expended upon
    them in their separation. This energy, when it is thus given out again,
    assumes the dynamical form of heat; in other words, the molecule gives
    out <em>heat</em> in the act of freezing. The heat thus given out may be
    employed to melt the next adjoining molecule. The ice-molecules take
    on energy from a heated body by melting. That peculiar form of motion
    or energy called heat disappears in forcing the particles of the
    crystalline molecule separate, and for the time being exists in the
    form of a tendency in the separated particles to come together again
    into the crystalline form.</p>

  <p>But it must be observed that although the crystalline molecule, when
    it is acting as a conductor, takes on energy under this form from the
    heated body, it only exists in the molecule under such a form during
    the moment of transmission; that is to say, the molecule is melted, but
    only for the moment. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span> B accepts of the energy from A, the molecule
    A instantly assumes the crystalline form. B is now melted; and when C
    accepts of the energy from B, then B also in turn assumes the solid
    state. This process goes on from molecule to molecule till the energy
    is transmitted through to the opposite side and the ice is left in its
    original solid state. This, as will be shown in the Appendix, is the
    <i lang="fr">rationale</i> of Faraday’s property of regelation.</p>

  <p>This is no mere theory or hypothesis; it is a necessary consequence
    from known facts. We know that ice at 32° cannot take on energy from
    a heated body without melting; and we know also equally well that a
    slab of ice at 32°, notwithstanding this, still, as a mass, retains its
    solid state while the heat is being transmitted through it. This proves
    that every molecule resumes its crystalline form the moment after the
    energy is transferred to the adjoining molecule.</p>

  <p>This point being established, every difficulty regarding the descent
    of the glacier entirely disappears; for a molecule the moment that
    it assumes the fluid state is completely freed from shearing-force,
    and can descend by virtue of its own weight without any impediment.
    All that the molecule requires is simply room or space to advance in.
    If the molecule were in absolute contact with the adjoining molecule
    below, it would not descend unless it could push that molecule before
    it, which it probably would not be able to do. But the molecule
    actually has room in which to advance; for in passing from the solid
    to the liquid state its volume is diminished by about 1/10, and it
    consequently can descend. True, when it again assumes the solid form
    it will regain its former volume; but the question is, will it go back
    to its old position? If we examine the matter thoroughly we shall find
    that it cannot. If there were only this one molecule affected by the
    heat, this molecule would certainly not descend; but all the molecules
    are similarly affected, although not all at the same moment of time.</p>

  <p>Let us observe what takes place, say, at the lower end of the glacier.
    The molecule A at the lower end, say, of the surface,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span> receives heat
    from the sun’s rays; it melts, and in melting not only loses its
    shearing-force and descends by its own weight, but it contracts also.
    B immediately above it is now, so far as A is concerned, at liberty to
    descend, and will do so the moment that it assumes the liquid state. A
    by this time has become solid, and again fixed by shearing-force; but
    it is not fixed in its old position, but a little below where it was
    before. If B has not already passed into the fluid state in consequence
    of heat derived from the sun, the additional supply which it will
    receive from the solidifying of A will melt it. The moment that B
    becomes fluid it will descend till it reaches A. B then is solidified
    a little below its former position. The same process of reasoning is
    in a similar manner applicable to every molecule of the glacier. Each
    molecule of the glacier consequently descends step by step as it melts
    and solidifies, and hence the glacier, considered as a mass, is in a
    state of constant motion downwards. The fact observed by Professor
    Tyndall that there are certain planes in the ice along which melting
    takes place more readily than others will perhaps favour the descent of
    the glacier.</p>

  <p>We have in this theory a satisfactory explanation of the origin of
    “crevasses” in glaciers. Take, for example, the transverse crevasses
    formed at the point where an increase in the inclination of the glacier
    takes place. Suppose a change of inclination from, say, 4° to 8° in
    the bed of the glacier. The molecules on the slope of 8° will descend
    more rapidly than those above on the slope of 4°. A state of tension
    will therefore be induced at the point where the change of inclination
    occurs. The ice on the slope of 8° will tend to pull after it the mass
    of the glacier moving more slowly on the slope above. The pull being
    continued, the glacier will snap asunder the moment that the cohesion
    of the ice is overcome. The greater the change of inclination is, the
    more readily will the rupture of the ice take place. Every species of
    crevasse can be explained upon the same principle.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span></p>

  <p>This theory explains also why a glacier moves at a greater rate during
    summer than during winter; for as the supply of heat to the glacier is
    greater during the former season than during the latter, the molecules
    will pass oftener into the liquid state.</p>

  <p>As regards the denuding power of glaciers, I may observe that, though
    a glacier descends molecule by molecule, it will grind the rocky bed
    over which it moves as effectually as it would do did it slide down in
    a rigid mass in the way generally supposed; for the grinding-effect
    is produced not by the ice of the glacier, but by the stones, sand,
    and other materials forced along under it. But if all the resistances
    opposing the descent of a glacier, internal and external, are overcome
    by the mere weight of the ice alone, it can be proved that in the case
    of one descending with a given velocity the amount of work performed
    in forcing the grinding materials lying under the ice forward must be
    as great, supposing the motion of the ice to be molecular in the way
    I have explained, as it would be supposing the ice descended in the
    manner generally supposed.</p>

  <p>Of course, a glacier could not descend by means of its weight as
    rapidly in the latter case as in the former; for, in fact, as Canon
    Moseley has shown, it would not in the latter case descend at all; but
    assuming for the sake of argument the rate of descent in both cases to
    be the same, the conclusion I have stated would follow. Consequently
    whatever denuding effects may have been attributed to the glacier,
    according to the ordinary theory, must be equally attributable to it
    according to the present explanation.</p>

  <p>This theory, however, explains, what has always hitherto excited
    astonishment, viz., why a glacier can descend a slope almost
    horizontal, or why the ice can move off the face of a continent
    perfectly level.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span></p>

  <p>This is the form in which my explanation was first stated about
    half-a-dozen years ago.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> There is, however another element
    which must be taken into account. It is one which will help to cast
    additional light on some obscure points connected with glacial
    phenomena.</p>

  <p>Ice is evidently not absolutely solid throughout. It is composed of
    crystalline particles, which, though in contact with one another, are,
    however, not packed together so as to occupy the least possible space,
    and, even though they were, the particles would not fit so closely
    together as to exclude interstices. The crystalline particles are,
    however, united to one another at special points determined by their
    polarity, and on this account they require more space; and this in
    all probability is the reason, as Professor Tyndall remarks, why ice,
    volume for volume, is less dense than water.</p>

  <p>“They (the molecules) like the magnets,” says Professor Tyndall, “are
    acted upon by two distinct forces; for a time, while the liquid is
    being cooled, they approach each other, in obedience to their general
    attraction for each other. But at a certain point new forces, some
    attractive some repulsive, <em>emanating from special points</em> of the
    molecules, come into play. The attracted points close up, the repelled
    points retreat. Thus the molecules turn and rearrange themselves,
    demanding as they do so more space, and overcoming all ordinary
    resistance by the energy of their demand. This, in general terms, is an
    explanation of the expansion of water in solidifying.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

  <p>It will be obvious, then, that when a crystalline molecule melts, it
    will not merely descend in the manner already described, but capillary
    attraction will cause it to flow into the interstices between the
    adjoining molecules. The moment that it parts with the heat received,
    it will of course resolidify, as has been shown, but it will not
    solidify so as to fit the cavity which it occupied when in the fluid
    state. For the liquid molecule in solidifying assumes the crystalline
    form, and of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>course there will be a definite proportion between the
    length, breadth, and thickness of the crystal; consequently it will
    always happen that the interstice in which it solidifies will be too
    narrow to contain it. The result will be that the fluid molecule
    in passing into the crystalline form will press the two adjoining
    molecules aside in order to make sufficient room for itself between
    them, and this it will do, no matter what amount of space it may
    possess in all other directions. The crystal will not form to suit the
    cavity, the cavity must be made to contain the crystal. And what holds
    true of one molecule, holds true of every molecule which melts and
    resolidifies. This process is therefore going on incessantly in every
    part of the glacier, and in proportion to the amount of heat which the
    glacier is receiving. This internal molecular pressure, resulting from
    the solidifying of the fluid molecules in the interstices of the ice,
    acts on the mass of the ice as an expansive force, tending to cause the
    glacier to widen out laterally in all directions.</p>

  <p>Conceive a mass of ice lying on a flat horizontal surface, and
    receiving heat on its upper surface, say from the sun; as the heat
    passes downwards through the mass, the molecules, acting as conductors,
    melt and resolidify. Each fluid molecule solidifies in an interstice,
    which has to be widened in order to contain it. The pressure thus
    exerted by the continual resolidifying of the molecules will cause the
    mass to widen out laterally, and of course as the mass widens out it
    will grow thinner and thinner if it does not receive fresh acquisition
    on its surface. In the case of a glacier lying in a valley, motion,
    however, will only take place in one direction. The sides of the
    valley prevent the glacier from widening; and as gravitation opposes
    the motion of the ice up, and favours its motion down the valley, the
    path of least resistance to molecular pressure will always be down
    the slope, and consequently in this direction molecular displacement
    will take place. Molecular pressure will therefore produce motion in
    the same direction as that of gravity. In other words, it will tend to
    cause the glacier to descend the valley.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span></p>

  <p>The lateral expansion of the ice from internal molecular pressure
    explains in a clear and satisfactory manner how rock-basins may be
    excavated by means of land-ice. It also removes the difficulties
    which have been felt in accounting for the ascent of ice up a steep
    slope. The main difficulty besetting the theory of the excavation of
    rock-basins by ice is to explain how the ice after entering the basin
    manages to get out again—how the ice at the bottom is made to ascend
    the sloping sides of the basin. Pressure acting from behind, it has
    been argued by some; but if the basin be deep and its sides steep, this
    will simply cause the ice lying above the level of the basin to move
    forward over the surface of the mass filling it. This conclusion is,
    however, incorrect. The ice filling the basin and the glacier overlying
    it are united in one solid mass, so that the latter cannot move over
    the former without shearing; and although the resistance to motion
    offered by the sloping sides of the basin may be much greater than the
    resistance to shear, still the ice will be slowly dragged out of the
    basin. However, in order to obviate this objection to which I refer,
    the advocates of the glacial origin of lake-basins point out that
    the length of those basins in proportion to their depth is so great
    that the slope up which the ice has to pass is in reality but small.
    This no doubt is true of lake-basins in general, but it does not hold
    universally true. But the theory does not demand that an ice-formed
    lake-basin cannot have steep sides. We have incontestable evidence that
    ice will pass up a steep slope; and, if ice can pass up a steep slope,
    it can excavate a basin with a steep slope. That ice will pass up a
    steep slope is proved by the fact that comparatively deep and narrow
    river valleys are often found striated across, while hills which stood
    directly in the path of the ice of the glacial epoch are sometimes
    found striated <em>upwards</em> from their base to their summit. Some striking
    examples of striæ running up hill are given by Professor Geikie in
    his “Glacial Drift of Scotland.” I have myself seen a slope striated
    upwards so steep that one could not climb it.</p>

  <p>A very good example of a river valley striated across came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span> under
    my observation during the past summer. The Tay, between Cargill
    and Stanley (in the centre of the broad plain of Strathmore), has
    excavated, through the Old Red Sandstone, a channel between 200 and
    300 feet in depth. The channel here runs at right angles to the path
    taken during the glacial epoch by the great mass of ice coming from
    the North-west Highlands. At a short distance below Cargill, the trap
    rising out of the bed of the river is beautifully ice-grooved and
    striated, at right angles to the stream. A trap-dyke, several miles in
    length, crosses the river about a mile above Stanley, forming a rapid,
    known as the Linn of Campsie. This dyke is <i lang="fr">moutonnée</i> and striated
    from near the Linn up the sloping bank to the level of the surrounding
    country, showing that the ice must have ascended a gradient of one in
    seven to a height of 300 feet.</p>

  <p>From what has been already stated in reference to the resolidifying of
    the molecules in the interstices of the ice, the application of the
    molecular theory to the explanation of the effects under consideration
    will no doubt be apparent. Take the case of the passage of the
    ice-sheet across a river valley. As the upper surface of the ice-sheet
    is constantly receiving heat from the sun and the air in contact with
    it, there is consequently a transferrence of heat from above downwards
    to the bottom of the sheet. This transferrence of heat from molecule
    to molecule is accompanied by the melting and resolidifying of the
    successive molecules in the manner already detailed. As the fluid
    molecules tend to flow into adjoining interstices before solidifying
    and assuming the crystalline form, the interstices of the ice at the
    bottom of the valley are constantly being filled by fluid molecules
    from above. These molecules no sooner enter the interstices than they
    pass into the crystalline form, and become, of course, separated from
    their neighbours by fresh interstices, which new interstices become
    filled by fluid molecules, which, in turn, crystallize, forming fresh
    interstices, and so on. The ice at the bottom of the valley, so long as
    this process continues, is constantly receiving fresh additions from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
    above. The ice must therefore expand laterally to make room for these
    additions, which it must do unless the resistance to lateral expansion
    be greater than the force exerted by the molecules in crystallizing.
    But a resistance sufficient to do this must be enormous. The ice at the
    bottom of the valley cannot expand laterally without passing up the
    sloping sides. In expanding it will take the path of least resistance,
    but the path of least resistance will always be on the side of the
    valley towards which the general mass of the ice above is flowing.</p>

  <p>It has been shown (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXVII">Chapter XXVII.</a>) that the ice passing over Strathmore
    must have been over 2,000 feet in thickness. An ice-sheet 2,000 feet
    in thickness exerts on its bed a pressure of upwards of 51 tons per
    square foot. When we reflect that ice under so enormous a pressure,
    with grinding materials lying underneath, was forced by irresistible
    molecular energy up an incline of one in seven, it is not at all
    surprising that the hard trap should be ground down and striated.</p>

  <p>We can also understand how the softer portions of the rocky surface
    over which the ice moved should have been excavated into hollow basins.
    We have also an explanation of the transport of boulders from a lower
    to a higher level, for if ice can move from a lower to a higher level,
    it of course can carry boulders along with it.</p>

  <p>The bearing which the foregoing considerations of the manner in which
    heat is transmitted through ice have on the question of the cause of
    regelation will be considered in the Appendix.</p>

  <p>“Œpinus,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> reasoning on astronomical principles, attributes the
    inferior temperature of the southern hemisphere to the shorter abode of
    the sun in the southern tropic, shorter by seven days, which produces
    a difference of fourteen days in favour of the northern hemisphere,
    during which more heat is accumulated, and hence he infers that the
    temperature of the northern hemisphere is to that of the southern, as
    189·5 to 175·5, or as 14 to 13.”—<cite>Trans. of the Royal Irish Academy</cite>,
    vol. viii., p. 417. 1802.</p>

  <h4>SIR CHARLES LYELL.</h4>

  <p>“Before the amount of difference between the temperature of the two
    hemispheres was ascertained, it was referred by astronomers to the
    acceleration of the earth’s motion in its perihelion; in consequence of
    which the spring and summer of the southern hemisphere are shorter by
    nearly eight days than those seasons north of the equator. A sensible
    effect is probably produced by this source of disturbance, but it is
    quite inadequate to explain the whole phenomena. It is, however, of
    importance to the geologist to bear in mind that in consequence of the
    precession of the equinoxes, the two hemispheres receive alternately,
    each for a period of upwards of 10,000 years, a greater share of
    solar light and heat. This cause may sometimes tend to counterbalance
    inequalities resulting from other circumstances of a far more
    influential nature; but, on the other hand, it must sometimes tend to
    increase the extreme of deviation, which certain combinations of causes
    produce at distant epochs.”—<cite>Principles</cite>, First Edition, 1830, p. 110,
    vol. i.</p>

  <h4>SIR JOHN F. HERSCHEL, <span class="smcap">Bart.</span></h4>

  <p>The following, in so far as it relates to the effects of eccentricity,
    is a copy of Sir John Herschel’s memoir, “On the Astronomical Causes
    which may influence Geological Phenomena,” read before the Geological
    Society, Dec. 15th, 1830.—<cite>Trans. Geol. Soc.</cite>, vol. iii., p. 293,
    Second Series:—</p>

  <p>“... Let us next consider the changes arising in the orbit of the earth
    itself about the sun, from the disturbing action of the planets. In so
    doing it will be obviously unnecessary to consider the effect produced
    on the solar tides, to which the above reasoning applies much more
    forcibly than in the case of the lunar. It is, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>therefore, only the
    variations in the supply of light and heat received from the sun that
    we have now to consider.</p>

  <p>“Geometers having demonstrated the absolute invariability of the <em>mean</em>
    distance of the earth from the sun, it would seem to follow that
    the mean annual supply of light and heat derived from that luminary
    would be alike invariable; but a closer consideration of the subject
    will show that this would not be a legitimate conclusion, but that,
    on the contrary, the <em>mean</em> amount of solar radiation is dependent
    on the eccentricity of the orbit, and therefore liable to variation.
    Without going at present into any geometrical investigations, it will
    be sufficient for the purpose here to state it as a theorem, of which
    any one may easily satisfy himself by no very abstruse geometrical
    reasoning, that ‘<em>the eccentricity of the orbit varying, the</em> total
    <em>quantity of heat received by the earth from the sun in one revolution
    is inversely proportional to the</em> minor <em>axis of the orbit</em>.’ Now since
    the major axis is, as above observed, invariable, and therefore, of
    course, the absolute length of the year, it will follow that the <em>mean
    annual</em> average of heat will also be in the same inverse ratio of the
    <em>minor</em> axis; and thus we see that the very circumstance which on a
    cursory view we should have regarded as demonstrative of the constancy
    of our supply of solar heat, forms an essential link in the chain of
    strict reasoning by which its variability is proved.</p>

  <p>“The eccentricity of the earth’s orbits is actually diminishing, and
    has been so for ages, beyond the records of history. In consequence,
    the ellipse is in a state of approach to a circle, and its minor
    axis being, therefore, on the increase, the annual average of solar
    radiation is actually on the <em>decrease</em>.</p>

  <p>“So far this is in accordance with the testimony of geological
    evidence, which indicates a general refrigeration of climate; but when
    we come to consider the amount of diminution which the eccentricity
    must be supposed to have undergone to render an account of the
    variation which has taken place, we have to consider that, in the first
    place, a great diminution of the eccentricity is required to produce
    any sensible increase of the minor axis. This is a purely geometrical
    conclusion, and is best shown by the following table:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">By this it appears that a variation of the eccentricity of the orbit
    from the circular form to that of an ellipse, having an eccentricity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
    of one-fourth of the major axis, would produce only a variation of 3
    per cent. on the <em>mean</em> annual amount of solar radiation, and this
    variation takes in the whole range of the planetary eccentricities,
    from that of Pallas and Juno downwards.</p>

  <p>“I am not aware that the limit of increase of the eccentricity of the
    earth’s orbit has ever been determined. That it has a limit has been
    satisfactorily proved; but the celebrated theorem of Laplace, which
    is usually cited as demonstrating that none of the planetary orbits
    can ever deviate materially from the circular form, leads to no such
    conclusion, except in the case of the great preponderant planets
    Jupiter and Saturn, while for anything that theorem proves to the
    contrary, the orbit of the earth may become elliptic to any amount.</p>

  <p>“In the absence of calculations which though practicable have, I
    believe, never been made,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and would be no slight undertaking, we
    may assume that eccentricities which exist in the orbits of planets,
    both interior and exterior to that of the earth, may <em>possibly</em>
    have been attained, and may be attained again by that of the earth
    itself. It is clear that such eccentricities <em>existing</em> they cannot
    be incompatible with the stability of the system generally, and that,
    therefore, the question of the possibility of such an amount in the
    particular case of the earth’s orbit will depend on the particular
    data belonging to that case, and can only be determined by executing
    the calculations alluded to, having regard to the simultaneous effects
    of at least the four most influential planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
    and Saturn, <em>not only on the orbit of the earth, but on those of each
    other</em>. The principles of this calculation are detailed in the article
    of Laplace’s work cited. But before entering on a work of so much
    labour, it is quite necessary to inquire what prospect of advantage
    there is to induce any one to undertake it.</p>

  <p>“Now it certainly at first sight seems clear that a variation of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>3
    per cent. only in the mean annual amount of solar radiation, and
    that arising from an extreme supposition, does <em>not</em> hold out such a
    prospect. Yet it might be argued that the effects of the sun’s heat is
    to maintain the temperature of the earth’s surface at its actual mean
    height, not above the zero of Fahrenheit’s or any other thermometer,
    but above the temperature of the celestial spaces, out of the reach of
    the sun’s influence, and what that temperature is may be a matter of
    much discussion. M. Fourier has considered it as demonstrated that it
    is not greatly inferior to that of the polar regions of our own globe,
    but the grounds of this decision appear to me open to considerable
    objection.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> If those regions be really void of matter, their
    temperature can only arise, according to M. Fourier’s own view of
    the subject, from the radiation of the stars. It ought, therefore,
    to be as much inferior to that due to solar radiation, as the light
    of a starlight night is to that of the brightest noon day, in other
    words it should be very nearly a total privation of heat—almost the
    <em>absolute zero</em> respecting which so much difference of opinion exists,
    some placing it at 1,000°, some at 5,000° of Fahrenheit below the
    freezing-point, and some still lower, in which case a single unit per
    cent. in the mean annual amount of radiation would suffice to produce a
    change of climate fully commensurate to the demands of geologists.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

  <p>“Without attempting, however, to enter further into the perplexing
    difficulties in which this point is involved, which are far greater
    than appear on a cursory view, let us next consider, not the <em>mean</em>,
    but the <em>extreme</em> effects which a variation in the eccentricity of
    the earth’s orbit may be expected to produce in the summer and winter
    climates in particular regions of its surface, and under the influence
    of circumstances favouring a difference of effect. And here, if I
    mistake not, it will appear that an amount of variation, which we need
    not hesitate to admit (at least, provisionally) as a possible one, may
    be productive of considerable diversity of climate, and may operate
    during great periods of time either to mitigate or to exaggerate
    the difference of winter and summer temperatures, so as to produce
    alternately, in the same latitude of either hemisphere, a perpetual
    spring, or the extreme vicissitudes of a burning summer and a rigorous
    winter.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span></p>

  <p>“To show this, let us at once take the extreme case of an orbit as
    eccentric as that of Juno or Pallas, in which the greatest and least
    distances of the sun are to each other as 5 to 3, and consequently the
    radiations at those distances as 25 to 9, or very nearly as 3 to 1. To
    conceive what would be the <em>extreme</em> effects of this great variation
    of the heat received at different periods of the year, let us first
    imagine in our latitude the place of the perigee of the sun to coincide
    with the summer solstice. In that case, the difference between the
    summer and winter temperature would be exaggerated in the same degree
    as if three suns were placed side by side in the heavens in the former
    season and only one in the latter, which would produce a climate
    perfectly intolerable. On the other hand, were the perigee situated
    in the winter solstice our three suns would combine to warm us in the
    winter, and would afford such an excess of winter radiation as would
    probably more than counteract the effect of short days and oblique
    sunshine, and throw the summer season into the winter months.</p>

  <p>“The actual diminution of the eccentricity is so slow, that the
    transition from a state of the orbit such as we have assumed to the
    present nearly circular figure would occupy upwards of 600,000 years,
    supposing it uniformly changeable—this, of course, would not be the
    case; when near the maximum, however, it would vary slower still, so
    that at that point it is evident a period of 10,000 years would elapse
    without any perceptible change in the state of the data of the case we
    are considering.</p>

  <p>“Now this adopting the very ingenious idea of Mr. Lyell<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> would
    suffice, by reason of the combined effect of the precession of the
    equinoxes and the motion of the apsides of the orbit itself, to
    transfer the perigee from the summer to the winter solstice, and thus
    to produce a transition from the one to the other species of climate in
    a period sufficiently great to give room for a material change in the
    botanical character of country.</p>

  <p>“The supposition above made is an extreme, but it is not demonstrated
    to be an impossible one, and should even an approach to such a state
    of things be possible, the same consequences, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>in a mitigated degree,
    would follow. But if, on executing the calculations, it should appear
    that the limits of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit are really
    narrow, and if, on a full discussion of the very difficult and delicate
    point of the actual effect of solar radiation, it should appear that
    the mean, as well as the extreme, temperature of our climates would
    <em>not</em> be materially affected,—it will be at least satisfactory to
    <em>know</em> that the causes of the phenomena in question are to be sought
    elsewhere than in the relations of our planet to the system to which
    it belongs, since there does not appear to exist any other conceivable
    connections between these relations and the facts of geology than
    those we have enumerated, the obliquity of the ecliptic being, as we
    know, confined within too narrow limits for its variation to have any
    sensible influence.”—<cite>J. F. W. Herschel.</cite></p>

  <p>The influence which this paper might have had on the question as
    to whether eccentricity may be regarded as a cause of changes in
    geological climate appears to have been completely neutralized by the
    following, which appeared shortly afterwards both in his “Treatise” and
    “Outlines of Astronomy,” showing evidently that he had changed his mind
    on the subject.</p>

  <p>“It appears, therefore, from what has been shown, the supplies of heat
    received from the sun will be equal in the two segments, in whatever
    direction the line PTQ be drawn. They will, indeed, be described in
    unequal times: that in which the perihelion A lies in a shorter, and
    the other in a longer, in proportion to their unequal area; but the
    greater proximity of the sun in the smaller segment compensates exactly
    for its more rapid description, and thus an equilibrium of heat is, as
    it were, maintained.</p>

  <p>“Were it not for this the eccentricity of the orbit would materially
    influence the transition of seasons. The fluctuation of distance
    amounts to nearly 1/30th of the mean quantity, and, consequently,
    the fluctuation of the sun’s direct heating power to double this, or
    1/15th of the whole.... Were it not for the compensation we have just
    described, the effect would be to exaggerate the difference of summer
    and winter in the southern hemisphere, and to moderate it in the
    northern; thus producing a more violent alternation of climate in the
    one hemisphere and an approach to perpetual spring in the other. <em>As it
    is, however, no such inequality subsists</em>, but an equal and impartial
    distribution of heat and light is accorded to both.”—“<em>Treatise of
    Astronomy</em>,” <cite>Cabinet Cyclopædia</cite>, § 315; <cite>Outlines of Astronomy</cite>, §
    368.</p>

  <p>“The fact of a great change in the general climate of large tracts
    of the globe, if not of the whole earth, and of a diminution of
    general temperature, having been recognised by geologists, from
    their examination of the remains of animals and vegetables of former
    ages enclosed in the strata, various causes for such diminution of
    temperature have been assigned.... It is evident that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span> the <em>mean</em>
    temperature of the whole surface of the globe, in so far as it is
    maintained by the action of the sun at a higher degree than it would
    have were the sun extinguished, must depend on the mean quantity of
    the sun’s rays which it receives, or, which comes to the same thing,
    on the <em>total</em> quantity received in a given invariable time; and the
    length of the year being unchangeable in all the fluctuations of the
    planetary system, it follows that the total <em>annual</em> amount of solar
    radiation will determine, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, the general climate
    of the earth. Now, it is not difficult to show that this amount is
    inversely proportional to the minor axis of the ellipse described
    by the earth about the sun, regarded as slowly variable; and that,
    therefore, the major axis remaining, as we know it to be, constant,
    and the orbit being actually in a state of approach to a circle,
    and consequently the minor axis being on the <em>increase</em>, the mean
    annual amount of solar radiation received by the whole earth must
    be actually on the <em>decrease</em>. We have here, therefore, an evident
    real cause of sufficient universality, and acting <em>in the right
    direction</em>, to account for the phenomenon. Its adequacy is another
    consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>—<cite>Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy</cite>,
    pp. 145−147 (1830).</p>

  <h4>SIR CHARLES LYELL, <span class="smcap">Bart.</span></h4>

  <p>“<em>Astronomical Causes of Fluctuations in Climate.</em>—Sir John Herschel
    has lately inquired, whether there are any astronomical causes which
    may offer a possible explanation of the difference between the actual
    climate of the earth’s surface, and those which formerly appear to
    have prevailed. He has entered upon this subject, he says, ‘impressed
    with the magnificence of that view of geological revolutions, which
    regards them rather as regular and necessary effects of great and
    general causes, than as resulting from a series of convulsions
    and catastrophes, regulated by no laws, and reducible to no fixed
    principles.’ Geometers, he adds, have demonstrated the absolute
    invariability of the mean distance of the earth from the sun; whence
    it would seem to follow that the mean annual supply of light and heat
    derived from that luminary would be alike invariable; but a closer
    consideration of the subject will show that this would not be a
    legitimate conclusion, but that, on the contrary, the <em>mean</em> amount of
    solar radiation is dependent on the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit,
    and, therefore, liable to variation.</p>

  <p>“Now, the eccentricity of the orbit, he continues, is actually
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>diminishing, and has been so for ages beyond the records of history.
    In consequence, the ellipse is in a state of approach to a circle, and
    the annual average of solar heat radiated to the earth is actually on
    the <em>decrease</em>. So far, this is in accordance with geological evidence,
    which indicates a general refrigeration of climate; but the question
    remains, whether the amount of diminution which the eccentricity may
    have ever undergone can be supposed sufficient to account for any
    sensible refrigeration.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The calculations necessary to determine
    this point, though practicable, have never yet been made, and would be
    extremely laborious; for they must embrace all the perturbations which
    the most influential planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, would
    cause in the earth’s orbit and in each other’s movements round the sun.</p>

  <p>“The problem is also very complicated, inasmuch as it depends not
    merely on the ellipticity of the earth’s orbit, but on the assumed
    temperature of the celestial spaces beyond the earth’s atmosphere;
    a matter still open to discussion, and on which M. Fourier and Sir
    J. Herschel have arrived at very different opinions. But if, says
    Herschel, we suppose an extreme case, as if the earth’s orbit should
    ever become as eccentric as that of the planet Juno or Pallas, a great
    change of climate might be conceived to result, the winter and summer
    temperatures being sometimes mitigated and at others exaggerated, in
    the same latitudes.</p>

  <p>“It is much to be desired that the calculations alluded to were
    executed, as even if they should demonstrate, as M. Arago thinks highly
    probable, that the mean of solar radiation can never be materially
    affected by irregularities in the earth’s motion, it would still be
    satisfactory to ascertain the point.”—<cite>Principles of Geology</cite>, Ninth
    Edition, 1853, p. 127.</p>

  <h4>M. ARAGO.</h4>

  <p>“<i>Can the variations which certain astronomical elements undergo
    sensibly modify terrestrial climates?</i></p>

  <p>“The sun is not always equally distant from the earth. At this time
    its least distance is observed in the first days of January, and the
    greatest, six months after, or in the first days of July. But, on the
    other hand, a time will come when the <em>minimum</em> will occur in July,
    and the <em>maximum</em> in January. Here, then, this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>interesting question
    presents itself,—Should a summer such as those we now have, in which
    the <em>maximum</em> corresponds to the solar distance, differ sensibly, from
    a summer with which the <em>minimum</em> of this distance should coincide?</p>

  <p>“At first sight every one probably would answer in the affirmative;
    for, between the <em>maximum</em> and the <em>minimum</em> of the sun’s distance
    from the earth there is a remarkable difference, a difference in round
    numbers of a thirtieth of the whole. Let, however, the consideration of
    the velocities be introduced into the problem, elements which cannot
    fairly be neglected, and the result will be on the side opposite to
    that we originally imagined.</p>

  <p>“The part of the orbit where the sun is found nearest the earth, is, at
    the same time, the point where the luminary moves most rapidly along.
    The demi-orbit, or, in other words, the 180° comprehended betwixt the
    two equinoxes of spring-time and autumn, will then be traversed in the
    least possible time, when, in moving from the one of the extremities
    of this arc to the other, the sun shall pass, near the middle of
    this course of six months, at the point of the smallest distance. To
    resume—the hypothesis we have just adopted would give, on account of
    the lesser distance, a spring-time and summer hotter than they are in
    our days; but on account of the greater rapidity, the sum of the two
    seasons would be shorter by about seven days. Thus, then, all things
    considered, the compensation is mathematically exact. After this it is
    superfluous to add, that the point of the sun’s orbit corresponding to
    the earth’s least distance changes very gradually; and that since the
    most distant periods, the luminary has always passed by this point,
    either at the end of autumn or beginning of winter.</p>

  <p>“We have thus seen that the changes which take place in the <em>position</em>
    of the solar orbit, <em>have no power in modifying the climate of our
    globe</em>. We may now inquire, if it be the same concerning the variations
    which this orbit experiences in its <em>form</em>....</p>

  <p>“Herschel, who has recently been occupying himself with this problem,
    in the hope of discovering the explanation of several geological
    phenomena, allows that the succession of ages might bring the
    eccentricity of the terrestrial orbit to the proportion of that of
    the planet Pallas, that is to say, to be the 25/100 of a semi-greater
    axis. It is exceedingly improbable that in these periodical changes
    the eccentricity of our orbit should ever experience such enormous
    variations, and even then these twenty-five hundredth parts (25/100),
    would not augment the <em>mean</em> annual solar radiation except by about one
    hundredth part (1/100). To repeat, an eccentricity of 25/100 <em>would not
    alter in any appreciated manner the mean thermometrical state of the
    globe</em>....</p>

  <p>“The changes of the form, and of the position, of the terrestrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
    orbit are mathematically inoperative, or, at most, their influence is
    so minute that it is not indicated by the most delicate instruments.
    For the explanation of the changes of climates, then, there only
    remains to us either the local circumstances, or some alteration in
    the heating or illuminating power of the sun. But of these two causes,
    we may continue to reject the last. And thus, in fact, all the changes
    would come to be attributed to agricultural operations, to the clearing
    of plains and mountains from wood, the draining of morasses, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>“Thus, at one swoop, to confine, the whole earth, the variations

  <h4>BARON HUMBOLDT.</h4>

  <p>“The question,” he says, “has been raised as to whether the increasing
    value of this ellipticity is capable during thousands of years of
    modifying to any considerable extent the temperature of the earth,
    in reference to the daily and annual quantity and distribution of
    heat? Whether a partial solution of the great geological problem of
    the imbedding of tropical vegetable and animal remains in the now
    cold zones may not be found in these <em>astronomical</em> causes proceeding
    regularly in accordance with eternal laws?... It might at the first
    glance be supposed that the occurrence of the perihelion at an opposite
    time of the year (instead of the winter, as, is now the case, in
    summer) must necessarily produce great climatic variations; but, on the
    above supposition, the sun will no longer remain seven days longer in
    the northern hemisphere; no longer, as is now the case, traverse that
    part of the ecliptic from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox,
    in a space of time which is one week shorter than that in which it
    traverses the other half of its orbit from the vernal to the autumnal
    equinox.</p>

  <p>“The difference of temperature which is considered as the consequence
    to be apprehended from the turning of the major axis, <em>will on the
    whole disappear</em>, principally from the circumstance that the point of
    our planet’s orbit in which it is nearest to the sun is at the same
    time always that over which it passes with the greatest velocity....</p>

  <p>“As the altered position of the major axis is capable of exerting
    only a very <em>slight influence upon the temperature of the earth;</em> so
    likewise the <em>limit</em> of the probable changes in the elliptical form of
    the earth’s orbit are, according to Arago and Poisson, so narrow that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
    these changes could <em>only very slightly</em> modify the climates of the

  <h4>SIR HENRY T. DE LA BECHE.</h4>

  <p>“Mr. Herschel, viewing this subject with the eye of an astronomer,
    considers that a diminution of the surface-temperature might arise from
    a change in ellipticity of the earth’s orbit, which, though slowly,
    gradually becomes more circular. No calculations having yet been made
    as to the probable amount of decreased temperature from this cause,
    it can at present be only considered as a possible explanation of
    those geological phenomena which point to considerable alterations in
    climates.”—<cite>Geological Manual</cite>. Third Edition. 1833. p. 8.</p>

  <h4>PROFESSOR PHILLIPS.</h4>

  <p>“<em>Temperature of the Globe.</em>—<em>Influence of the Sun.</em>—No proposition is
    more certain than the fundamental dependence of the temperature of the
    surface of the globe on the solar influence.</p>

  <p>“It is, therefore, very important for geologists to inquire whether
    this be variable or constant; whether the amount of solar heat
    communicated to the earth is and has always been the same in every
    annual period, or what latitude the laws of planetary movements permit
    in this respect.</p>

  <p>“Sir John Herschel has examined this question in a satisfactory manner,
    in a paper read to the Geological Society of London. The total amount
    of solar radiation which determines the general climate of the earth,
    the year being of invariable length, is inversely proportional to
    the minor axis of the ellipse described by the earth about the sun,
    regarded as slowly variable; the major axis remaining constant and
    the orbit being actually in a state of approach to a circle, and,
    consequently, the minor axis being on the increase, it follows that
    the mean annual amount of solar radiation received by the whole earth
    must be actually on the decrease. The limits of the variation in the
    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit are not known. It is, therefore,
    impossible to say accurately what may have been in former periods of
    time, the amount of solar radiation; it is, however, certain that
    if the ellipticity has ever been so great as that of the orbit of
    Mercury or Pallas, the temperature of the earth must have been sensibly
    higher than it is at present. But the difference of a few degrees of
    temperature thus occasioned, is of too small an order to be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>employed
    in explaining the growth of tropical plants and corals in the polar
    or temperate zones, and other great phenomena of Geology.”—<em>From A

  <h4>MR. ROBERT BAKEWELL.</h4>

  <p>“A change in the form of the earth’s orbit, if considerable, might
    change the temperature of the earth, by bringing it nearer to the
    sun in one part of its course. The orbit of the earth is an ellipsis
    approaching nearly to a circle; the distance from the centre of the
    orbit to either focus of the ellipsis is called by astronomers ‘the
    eccentricity of the orbit.’ This eccentricity has been for ages slowly
    decreasing, or, in other words, the orbit of the earth has been
    approaching nearer to the form of a perfect circle; after a long period
    it will again increase, and the possible extent of the variation has
    not been yet ascertained. From what is known respecting the orbits of
    Jupiter and Saturn, it appears highly probable that the eccentricity of
    the earth’s orbit is confined within limits that preclude the belief
    of any great change in the mean annual temperature of the globe ever
    having been occasioned by this cause.”—<cite>Introduction to Geology</cite>, p.
    600. 1838. Fifth Edition.</p>

  <h4>MRS. SOMERVILLE.</h4>

  <p>“Sir John Herschel has shown that the elliptical form of the earth’s
    orbit has but a trifling share in producing the variation of
    temperature corresponding to the difference of the seasons.”—<cite>Physical
    Geography</cite>, vol. ii., p. 20. Third Edition.</p>

  <h4>MR. L. W. MEECH, A.M.</h4>

  <p>“Let us, then, look back to that primeval epoch when the earth
    was in aphelion at midsummer, and the eccentricity at its maximum
    value—assigned by Leverrier near to ·0777. Without entering into
    elaborate computation, it is easy to see that the extreme values
    of diurnal intensity, in Section IV., would be altered as by the
    multiplier <span class="xxlarge">(</span><span class="frac"><sup>1 ± <i>e</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>1 ± <i>e′</i></sub></span><span class="xxlarge">)</span><sup>2</sup>,
    that is 1 − 0·11 in summer, and 1
    + 0·11 in winter. This would diminish the midsummer intensity by about
    9°, and increase the midwinter intensity by 3° or 4°; the temperature
    of spring and autumn being nearly unchanged. But this does not appear
    to be of itself adequate to the geological effects in question.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span></p>

  <p>“It is not our purpose, here, to enter into the inquiry whether the
    atmosphere was once more dense than now, whether the earth’s axis
    had once a different inclination to the orbit, or the sun a greater
    emissive power of heat and light. Neither shall we attempt to speculate
    upon the primitive heat of the earth, nor of planetary space, nor of
    the supposed connection of terrestrial heat and magnetism; nor inquire
    how far the existence of coal-fields in this latitude, of fossils,
    and other geological remains, have depended upon existing causes. The
    preceding discussion seems to prove simply that, under the present
    system of physical astronomy, the sun’s intensity could never have been
    materially different from what is manifested upon the earth at the
    present day. <em>The causes of notable geological changes must be other
    than the relative position of the sun and earth, under their present

  <h4>M. ADHÉMAR.</h4>

  <p>Adhémar does not consider the effects which ought to result from a
    change in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit; he only concerns
    himself with those which, in his opinion, arise from the present amount
    of such eccentricity. He admits, of course, that both hemispheres
    receive from the sun equal quantities of heat per annum; but, as
    the southern hemisphere has a winter longer by 168 hours than the
    corresponding season in the northern hemisphere, an accumulation of
    heat necessarily takes place in the latter, and an accumulation of
    cold in the former. Adhémar also measures the loss of heat sustained
    by the southern hemisphere in a year by the number of hours by which
    the southern exceeds the northern winter. “The south pole,” he says,
    “loses in one year more heat than it receives, because the total
    duration of its nights surpasses that of the days by 168 hours; and the
    contrary takes place for the north pole. If, for example, we take for
    unity the mean quantity of heat which the sun sends off in one hour,
    the heat accumulated at the end of the year at the north pole will be
    expressed by 168, while the heat lost by the south pole will be equal
    to 168 times what the radiation lessens it by in one hour; so that at
    the end of the year the difference in the heat of the two hemispheres
    will be represented by 336 times what the earth receives from the sun
    or loses in an hour by radiation,”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and at the end of 100 years the
    difference will be 33,600 times, and at the end of 1,000 years 336,000
    times, or equal to what the earth receives from the sun in 38½ years,
    and so on during the 10,000 years that the southern winter exceeds in
    length the northern. This, in his opinion, is all that is required to
    melt the ice off the arctic regions, and cover the antarctic regions
    with an enormous ice-cap. He further supposes that in about 10,000
    years, when our northern winter will occur in aphelion and the southern
    in perihelion, the climatic conditions of the two hemispheres will be
    reversed; that is to say, the ice will melt at the south pole, and the
    northern hemisphere will become enveloped in one continuous mass of
    ice, leagues in thickness, extending down to temperate regions.</p>

  <p>This theory, as shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a>, is based upon a misconception
    regarding the laws of radiant heat. The loss of heat sustained by the
    southern hemisphere from radiation, resulting from the greater length
    of the southern winter, is vastly over-estimated by M. Adhémar, and
    could not possibly produce the effects which he supposes. But I need
    not enter into this subject here, as the reader will find the whole
    question discussed at length in the chapter above referred to. By far
    the most important part of Adhemar’s theory, however, is his conception
    of the submergence <span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>of the land by means of a polar ice-cap. He appears
    to have been the first to put forth the idea that a mass of ice placed
    on the globe, say, for example, at the south pole, will shift the
    earth’s centre of gravity a little to the south of its former position,
    and thus, as a physical consequence, cause the sea to sink at the
    north pole and to rise at the south. According to Adhémar, as the one
    hemisphere cools and the other grows warmer, the ice at the pole of the
    former will increase in thickness and that at the pole of the latter
    diminish.</p>

  <p>The sea, as a consequence, will sink on the warm hemisphere where the
    ice is decreasing and rise on the cold hemisphere where the ice is
    increasing. And, again, in 10,000 years, when the climatic conditions
    of the two hemispheres are reversed, the sea will sink on the
    hemisphere where it formerly rose, and rise on the hemisphere where it
    formerly sank, and so on in like manner through indefinite ages.</p>

  <p>Adhémar, however, acknowledges to have derived the grand conception
    of a submergence of the land from the shifting of the earth’s centre
    of gravity from the following wild speculation of one Bertrand, of
    Hamburgh:—</p>

  <p lang="fr">“Bertrand de Hambourg, dans un ouvrage imprimé en 1799 et qui a
    pour titre: <i lang="fr">Renouvellement périodique des Continents</i>, avait déjà
    émis cette idée, que la masse des eaux pouvait être alternativement
    entraînée d’un hémisphère à l’autre par le déplacement du centre de
    gravité du globe. Or, pour expliquer ce déplacement, il supposait que
    la terre était creuse et qu’il y avait dans son intérieur un gros noyau
    d’aimant auquel les comètes par leur attraction communiquaient un
    mouvement de va-et-vient analogue à celui du pendule.”—<cite>Révolutions de
    la Mer</cite>, p. 41.</p>

  <p>The somewhat extravagant notions which Adhémar has advanced in
    connection with his theory of submergence have very much retarded
    its acceptance. Amongst other remarkable views he supposes the polar
    ice-cap to rest on the bottom of the ocean, and to rise out of the
    water to the enormous height of twenty leagues. Again, he holds that
    on the winter approaching perihelion and the hemisphere becoming warm
    the ice waxes soft and rotten from the accumulated heat, and the sea
    now beginning to eat into the base of the cap, this is so undermined
    as, at last, to be left standing upon a kind of gigantic pedestal. This
    disintegrating process goes on till the fatal moment at length arrives,
    when the whole mass tumbles down into the sea in huge fragments which
    become floating icebergs. The attraction of the opposite ice-cap, which
    has by this time nearly reached its maximum thickness, becomes now
    predominant. The earth’s centre of gravity suddenly crosses the plain
    of the equator, dragging the ocean along with it, and carrying death
    and destruction to everything on the surface of the globe. And these
    catastrophes, he asserts, occur alternately on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span> the two hemispheres
    every 10,000 years.—<cite>Révolutions de la Mer</cite>, pp. 316−328.</p>

  <p>Adhémar’s theory has been advocated by M. Le Hon, of Brussels, in a
    work entitled <cite>Périodicité des Grands Déluges</cite>. Bruxelles et Leipzig,

  <div class="center mb3">ON THE NATURE OF HEAT-VIBRATIONS.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></div>

  <div class="center">From the <cite>Philosophical Magazine</cite> for May, 1864.</div>

  <p>In a most interesting paper on “Radiant Heat,” by Professor Tyndall,
    read before the Royal Society in March last, it is shown conclusively
    that the <em>period</em> of heat-vibrations is not affected by the state
    of aggregation of the molecules of the heated body; that is to say,
    whether the substance be in the gaseous, the liquid, or, perhaps, the
    solid condition, the tendency of its molecules to vibrate according to
    a given period remains unchanged. The force of cohesion binding the
    molecules together exercises no effect on the rapidity of vibration.</p>

  <p>I had arrived at the same conclusion from theoretical considerations
    several years ago, and had also deduced some further conclusions
    regarding the nature of heat-vibrations, which seem to be in a measure
    confirmed by the experimental results of Professor Tyndall. One of
    these conclusions was, that the heat-vibration does not consist in
    a motion of an aggregate mass of molecules, but in a motion of the
    individual molecules themselves. Each molecule, or rather we should
    say each atom, acts as if there were no other in existence but
    itself. Whether the atom stands by itself as in the gaseous state,
    or is bound to other atoms as in the liquid or the solid state, it
    behaves in exactly the same manner. The deeper question then suggested
    itself, viz., what is the nature of that mysterious motion called heat
    assumed by the atom? Does it consist in excursions across centres
    of equilibrium external to the atom itself? It is the generally
    received opinion among physicists that it does. But I think that the
    experimental results arrived at by Professor Tyndall, as well as some
    others which will presently be noticed, are entirely hostile to such an
    opinion. The relation of an atom to its centre of equilibrium depends
    entirely on the state of aggregation. Now if heat-vibrations consist in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>excursions to and fro across these centres, then the <em>period</em> ought to
    be affected by the state of aggregation. The higher the <em>tension</em> of
    the atom in regard to the centre, the more rapid ought its movement to
    be. This is the case in regard to the vibrations constituting sound.
    The harder a body becomes, or, in other words, the more firmly its
    molecules are bound together, the higher is the <em>pitch</em>. Two harp-cords
    struck with equal force will vibrate with equal force, however much
    they may differ in the rapidity of their vibrations. The <i lang="la">vis viva</i>
    of vibration depends upon the force of the stroke; but the rapidity
    depends, not on the stroke, but upon the tension of the cord.</p>

  <p>That heat-vibrations do not consist in excursions of the molecules
    or atoms across centres of equilibrium, follows also as a necessary
    consequence from the fact that the real specific heat of a body remains
    unchanged under all conditions. All changes in the specific heat of a
    body are due to differences in the amount of heat consumed in molecular
    work against cohesion or other forces binding the molecules together.
    Or, in other words, to produce in a body no other effect than a given
    rise of temperature, requires the same amount of force, whatever may be
    the physical condition of the body. Whether the body be in the solid,
    the fluid, or the gaseous condition, the same rise of temperature
    always indicates the same quantity of force consumed in the simple
    production of the rise. Now, if heat-vibrations consist in excursions
    of the atom to and fro across a centre of equilibrium <em>external to
    itself</em>, as is generally supposed, then the <em>real</em> specific heat of a
    solid body, for example, <em>ought to decrease with the hardness of the
    body</em>, because an increase in the strength of the force binding the
    molecules together would in such a case tend to favour the rise in the
    rapidity of the vibrations.</p>

  <p>These conclusions not only afford us an insight into the hidden nature
    of heat-vibrations, but they also appear to cast some light on the
    physical constitution of the atom itself. They seem to lead to the
    conclusion that the ultimate atom itself is <em>essentially elastic</em>.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
    For if heat-vibrations do not consist in excursions of the atom, then
    it must consist in alternate expansions and contractions of the atom
    itself. This again is opposed to the ordinary idea that the atom is
    essentially solid and impenetrable. But it favours the modern idea,
    that matter consists of forces of resistance acting from a centre.</p>

  <p>Professor Tyndall in a memoir read before the Royal Society “On a new
    Series of Chemical Reactions produced by Light,” has subsequently
    arrived at a similar conclusion in reference to the atomic nature of
    heat-vibrations. The following are his views on the subject:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span></p>

  <p>“A question of extreme importance in molecular physics here
    arises:—What is the real mechanism of this absorption, and where is its
    seat?</p>

  <p>“I figure, as others do, a molecule as a group of atoms, held together
    by their mutual forces, but still capable of motion among themselves.
    The vapour of the nitrite of amyl is to be regarded as an assemblage
    of such molecules. The question now before us is this:—In the act
    of absorption, is it the <em>molecules</em> that are effective, or is it
    their constituent <em>atoms?</em> Is the <i lang="la">vis viva</i> of the intercepted waves
    transferred to the molecule as a whole, or to its constituent parts?</p>

  <p>“The molecule, as a whole, can only vibrate in virtue of the forces
    exerted between it and its neighbour molecules. The intensity of these
    forces, and consequently the rate of vibration, would, in this case,
    be a function of the distance between the molecules. Now the identical
    absorption of the liquid and of the vaporous nitrite of amyl indicates
    an identical vibrating period on the part of liquid and vapour, and
    this, to my mind, amounts to an experimental demonstration that the
    absorption occurs in the main <em>within</em> the molecule. For it can hardly
    be supposed, if the absorption were the act of the molecule as a whole,
    that it could continue to affect waves of the same period after the
    substance had passed from the vaporous to the liquid state.”—<cite>Proc. of
    Roy. Soc.</cite>, No. 105. 1868.</p>

  <p>Professor W. A. Norton, in his memoir on “Molecular Physics,”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> has
    also arrived at results somewhat similar in reference to the nature of
    heat-vibrations. “It will be seen,” he says, “that these (Mr. Croll’s)
    ideas are in accordance with the conception of the constitution of a
    molecule adopted at the beginning of the present memoir (p. 193), and
    with the theory of heat-vibrations or heat-pulses deduced therefrom (p.
    196).”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

  <div class="hang mb3">ON THE REASON WHY THE DIFFERENCE OF READING BETWEEN A
    THERMOMETER EXPOSED TO DIRECT SUNSHINE AND ONE SHADED
    DIMINISHES AS WE ASCEND IN THE ATMOSPHERE.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></div>

  <div class="center">From the <cite>Philosophical Magazine</cite> for March, 1867.</div>

  <p>The remarkable fact was observed by Mr. Glaisher, that the difference
    of reading between a black-bulb thermometer exposed to the direct rays
    of the sun and one shaded diminishes as we ascend in the atmosphere.
    On viewing the matter under the light of Professor Tyndall’s important
    discovery regarding the influence of aqueous vapour on radiant heat,
    the fact stated by Mr. Glaisher appears to be in perfect harmony with
    theory. The following considerations will perhaps make this plain.</p>

  <p>The shaded thermometer marks the temperature of the surrounding
    air; but the exposed thermometer marks not the temperature of the
    air, but that of the bulb heated by the direct rays of the sun. The
    temperature of the bulb depends upon two elements: (1) the rate at
    which it receives heat by <em>direct radiation</em> from the sun above, the
    earth beneath, and all surrounding objects, and by <em>contact</em> with the
    air; (2) the rate at which it loses heat by radiation and by contact
    with the air. As regards the heat gained and lost by contact with the
    surrounding air, both thermometers are under the same conditions,
    or nearly so. We therefore require only to consider the element of
    radiation.</p>

  <p>We begin by comparing the two thermometers at the earth’s surface, and
    we find that they differ by a very considerable number of degrees.
    We now ascend some miles into the air, and on again comparing the
    thermometers we find that the difference between them has greatly
    diminished. It has been often proved, by direct observation, that the
    intensity of the sun’s rays increases as we rise in the atmosphere.
    How then does the exposed thermometer sink more rapidly than the
    shaded one as we ascend? The reason is obviously this. The temperature
    of the thermometers depends as much upon the rate at which they are
    losing their heat as upon the rate at which they are gaining it.
    The higher temperature of the exposed thermometer is the result of
    <em>direct radiation</em> from the sun. Now, although this thermometer
    receives by radiation more heat <span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>from the sun at the upper position
    than at the lower, it does not necessarily follow on this account
    that its temperature ought to be higher. Suppose that at the upper
    position it should receive one-fourth more heat from the sun than at
    the lower, yet if the rate at which it loses its heat by radiation
    into space be, say, one-third greater at the upper position than at
    the lower, the temperature of the bulb would sink to a considerable
    extent, notwithstanding the extra amount of heat received. Let us now
    reflect on how matters stand in this respect in regard to the actual
    case under our consideration. When the exposed thermometer is at the
    higher position, it receives more heat from the sun than at the lower,
    but it receives less from the earth; for a considerable part of the
    radiation from the earth is cut off by the screen of aqueous vapour
    intervening between the thermometer and the earth. But, on the whole,
    it is probable that the total quantity of radiant heat reaching the
    thermometer is greater in the higher position than in the lower.
    Compare now the two positions in regard to the rate at which the
    thermometer loses its heat by radiation. When the thermometer is at the
    lower position, it has the warm surface of the ground against which to
    radiate its heat downwards. The high temperature of the ground thus
    tends to diminish the rate of radiation. Above, there is a screen of
    aqueous vapour throwing back upon the thermometer a very considerable
    part of the heat which the instrument is radiating upwards. This, of
    course, tends greatly to diminish the loss from radiation. But at
    the upper position this very screen, which prevented the thermometer
    from throwing off its heat into the cold space above, now affects
    the instrument in an opposite manner; for the thermometer has now to
    radiate its heat downwards, not upon the warm surface of the ground
    as before, but upon the cold upper surface of the aqueous screen
    intervening between the instrument and the earth. This of course tends
    to lower the mercury. We are now in a great measure above the aqueous
    screen, with nothing to protect the thermometer from the influence of
    cold stellar space. It is true that the air above is at a temperature
    little below that of the thermometer itself; but then the air is dry,
    and, owing to its diathermancy, it does not absorb the heat radiated
    from the thermometer, and consequently the instrument radiates its heat
    directly into the cold stellar space above, some hundreds of degrees
    below zero, almost the same as it would do were the air entirely
    removed. The enormous loss of heat which the thermometer now sustains
    causes it to fall in temperature to a great extent. The molecules of
    the comparatively dry air at this elevation, being very bad radiators,
    do not throw off their heat into space so rapidly as the bulb of the
    exposed thermometer; consequently their temperature does not (for this
    reason) tend to sink so rapidly as that of the bulb. Hence the shaded
    thermometer, which indicates the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span> temperature of those molecules, is
    not affected to such an extent as the exposed one. Hence also the
    difference of reading between the two instruments must diminish as we
    rise in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>This difference between the temperature of the two thermometers
    evidently does not go on diminishing to an indefinite extent. Were we
    able to continue our ascent in the atmosphere, we should certainly
    find that a point would be reached beyond which the difference of
    reading would begin to increase, and would continue to do so till the
    outer limits of the atmosphere were reached. The difference between
    the temperatures of the two thermometers beyond the limits of the
    atmosphere would certainly be enormous. The thermometer exposed to
    the direct rays of the sun would no doubt be much colder than it had
    been when at the earth’s surface; but the shaded thermometer would
    now indicate the temperature of space, which, according to Sir John
    Herschel and M. Pouillet, is more than 200° Fahrenheit below zero.</p>

  <p>It follows also, from what has been stated, that even under direct
    sunshine the removal of the earth’s atmosphere would tend to lower the
    temperature of the earth’s surface to a great extent. This conclusion
    also follows as an immediate inference from the fact that the earth’s
    atmosphere, as it exists at present charged with aqueous vapour,
    affects terrestrial radiation more than it does radiation from the sun;
    for the removal of the atmosphere would increase the rate at which the
    earth throws off its heat into space more than it would increase the
    rate at which it receives heat from the sun; therefore its temperature
    would necessarily fall until the rate of radiation <em>from</em> the earth’s
    surface exactly equalled the rate of radiation <em>to</em> the surface. Let
    the atmosphere again envelope the earth, and terrestrial radiation
    would instantly be diminished; the temperature of the earth’s surface
    would therefore necessarily begin to rise, and would continue to do so
    till the rate of radiation from the surface would equal the rate of
    radiation received by the surface. Equilibrium being thus restored, the
    temperature would remain stationary. It is perfectly obvious that if we
    envelope the earth with a substance such as our atmosphere, that offers
    more resistance to terrestrial radiation than to solar, the temperature
    of the earth’s surface must necessarily rise until the heat which is
    being radiated off equals that which is being received from the sun.
    Remove the air and thus get quit of the resistance, and the temperature
    of the surface would fall, because in this case a lower temperature
    would maintain equilibrium.</p>

  <p>It follows, therefore, that the moon, which has no atmosphere, must
    be much colder than our earth, even on the side exposed to the sun.
    Were our earth with its atmosphere as it exists at present removed to
    the orbit of Venus or Mars, for example, it certainly would not be
    habitable, owing to the great change of temperature that would result.
    But a change in the physical constitution <span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>of the atmospheric envelope
    is really all that would be necessary to retain the earth’s surface at
    its present temperature in either position.</p>

  <div class="hang mb3">REMARKS ON MR. J. Y. BUCHANAN’S THEORY OF THE VERTICAL
    DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE OF THE OCEAN.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></div>

  <p>Since the foregoing was in type, a paper on the “Vertical Distribution
    of Temperature of the Ocean,” by Mr. J. Y. Buchanan, chemist on board
    the <cite>Challenger</cite>, has been read before the Royal Society.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In that
    paper Mr. Buchanan endeavours to account for the great depth of warm
    water in the middle of the North Atlantic compared with that at the
    equator, without referring it to horizontal circulation of any kind.</p>

  <p>The following is the theory as stated by Mr. Buchanan:—</p>

  <p>“Let us assume the winter temperature of the surface-water to be 60° F.
    and the summer temperature to be 70° F. If we start from midwinter, we
    find that, as summer approaches, the surface-water must get gradually
    warmer, and that the temperature of the layers below the surface must
    decrease at a very rapid rate, until the stratum of winter temperature,
    or 60° F., is reached; in the language of the isothermal charts, the
    isothermal line for degrees between 70° F. (if we suppose that we have
    arrived at midsummer) and 60° F. open out or increase their distance
    from each other as the depth increases. Let us now consider the
    conditions after the summer heat has begun to waver. During the whole
    period of heating, the water, from its increasing temperature, has been
    always becoming lighter, so that heat communication by convection with
    the water below has been entirely suspended during the whole period.
    The heating of the surface-water has, however, had another effect,
    besides increasing its volume; it has, by evaporation, rendered it
    denser than it was before, at the same temperature. Keeping in view
    this double effect of the summer heat upon the surface-water, let us
    consider the effect of the winter cold upon it. The superficial water
    having assumed the atmospheric temperature of, say 60° F., will sink
    through the warmer water below it, until it reaches the stratum of
    water having the same temperature as itself. Arrived here, however,
    although it has the same temperature <span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>as the surrounding water,
    the two are no longer in equilibrium, for the water which has come
    from the surface, has a greater density than that below at the same
    temperature. It will therefore not be arrested at the stratum of the
    same temperature, as would have been the case with fresh water; but it
    will continue to sink, carrying of course its higher temperature with
    it, and distributing it among the lower layers of colder water. At
    the end of the winter, therefore, and just before the summer heating
    recommences, we shall have at the surface a more or less thick stratum
    of water having a nearly uniform temperature of 60° F., and below this
    the temperature decreasing at a considerable but less rapid rate than
    at the termination of the summer heating. If we distinguish between
    <em>surface-water</em>, the temperature of which rises with the atmospheric
    temperature (following thus, in direction at least, the variation of
    the seasons), and <em>subsurface</em>-water, or the stratum immediately below
    it, we have for the latter the, at first sight, paradoxical effect of
    summer cooling and winter heating. The effect of this agency is to
    diffuse the same heat to a greater depth in the ocean, the greater the
    yearly range of atmospheric temperature at the surface. This effect
    is well shown in the chart of isothermals, on a vertical section,
    between Madeira and a position in lat. 3° 8′ N., long. 14° 49′ W. The
    isothermal line for 45° F. rises from a depth of 740 fathoms at Madeira
    to 240 fathoms at the above-mentioned position. In equatorial regions
    there is hardly any variation in the surface-temperature of the sea;
    consequently we find cold water very close to the surface all along the
    line. On referring to the temperature section between the position lat.
    3° 8′ N., long. 14° 49′ W., and St. Paul’s Rocks, it will be seen that,
    with a surface-temperature of from 75° F. to 79° F., water at 55° F. is
    reached at distances of less than 100 fathoms from the surface. Midway
    between the Azores and Bermuda, with a surface-temperature of 70° F.,
    it is only at a depth of 400 fathoms that we reach water of 55° F.”</p>

  <p>What Mr. Buchanan states will explain why the mean annual temperature
    of the water at the surface extends to a greater depth in the middle
    of the North Atlantic than at the equator. It also explains why the
    temperature from the surface downwards decreases more rapidly at the
    equator than in the middle of the North Atlantic; but, if I rightly
    understand the theory, it does not explain (and this is the point at
    issue) why at a given depth the temperature of the water in the North
    Atlantic should be higher than the temperature at a corresponding depth
    at the equator. Were there no horizontal circulation the greatest
    thickness of warm water would certainly be found at the equator and
    the least at the poles. The isothermals would in such a case gradually
    slope downwards from the poles to the equator. The slope might not be
    uniform, but still it would be a continuous downward slope.</p>

  <div class="center mb3">ON THE CAUSE OF THE COOLING EFFECT PRODUCED ON SOLIDS BY
    TENSION.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></div>

  <div class="center">From the <cite>Philosophical Magazine</cite> for May, 1864.</div>

  <p>From a series of experiments made by Dr. Joule with his usual accuracy,
    he found that when bodies are subjected to tension, a cooling effect
    takes place. “The quantity of cold,” he says, “produced by the
    application of tension was sensibly equal to the heat evolved by its
    removal; and further, that the thermal effects were proportional to
    the weight employed.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> He found that when a weight was applied to
    compress a body, a certain amount of heat was evolved; but the same
    weight, if applied to stretch the body, produced a corresponding amount
    of cold.</p>

  <p>This, although it does not appear to have been remarked, is a most
    singular result. If we employ a force to compress a body, and then ask
    what has become of the force applied, it is quite a satisfactory answer
    to be told that the force is converted into heat, and reappears in the
    molecules of the body as such; but if the same force be employed to
    stretch the body, it will be no answer to be told that the force is
    converted into cold. Cold cannot be the force under another form, for
    cold is a privation of force. If a body, for example, is compressed by
    a weight, the <i lang="la">vis viva</i> of the descending weight is transmitted to the
    molecules of the body and reappears under that form of force called
    heat; but if the same weight is applied so as to stretch or expand the
    body, not only does the force of the weight disappear without producing
    heat, but the molecules which receive the force lose part of that
    which they already possessed. Not only does the force of the weight
    disappear, but along with it a portion of the force previously existing
    in the molecules under the form of heat. We have therefore to inquire,
    not merely into what becomes of the force imparted by the weight, but
    also what becomes of the force in the form of heat which disappears
    from the molecules of the body itself. That the <i lang="la">vis viva</i> of the
    descending weight should disappear without increasing the heat of the
    molecules is not so surprising, because it may be transformed into some
    other form of force different from that of heat. For it is by no means
    evident <i lang="la">à priori</i> that heat should be the only form under which it
    may exist. But it is somewhat strange that it should cause the force
    previously existing in the molecules in the form of heat also to change
    into some other form.</p>

  <p>When a weight, for example, is employed to stretch a solid body, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>it
    is evident that the force exerted by the weight is consumed in work
    against the cohesion of the particles, for the entire force is exerted
    so as to pull them separate from each other. But the cooling effect
    which takes place shows that more force disappears than simply what
    is exerted by the weight; for the cooling effect is caused by the
    disappearance of force in the shape of heat from the body itself. The
    force exerted by the weight disappears in performing work against the
    cohesion of the particles of the body stretched. But what becomes
    of the energy in the form of heat which disappears from the body at
    the same time? It must be consumed in performing work of some kind
    or other. The force exerted by the weight cannot be the cause of the
    cooling effect. The transferrence of force from the weight to the body
    may be the cause of a heating effect—an increase of force in the body;
    but this transferrence of force to the body cannot be the cause of a
    decrease of force in the body. If a decrease of force actually follows
    the application of tension, the weight can only be the occasion, not
    the cause of the decrease.</p>

  <p>In what manner, then, does the stretching of the body by the weight
    become the occasion of its losing energy in the shape of heat? Or, in
    other words, what is the cause of the cooling effects which result
    from tension? The probable explanation of the phenomenon seems to
    be this: if the molecules of a body are held together by any force,
    of whatever nature it may be, which prevents any further separation
    taking place, then the entire heat applied to such a body will appear
    as temperature; but if this binding force becomes lessened so as to
    allow further expansion, then a portion of the heat applied will be
    lost in producing expansion. All solids at any given temperature expand
    until the expansive force of their heat exactly balances the cohesive
    force of their molecules, after which no further expansion at the
    same temperature can possibly take place while the cohesive force of
    the molecules remains unchanged. But if, by some means or other, the
    cohesive force of the molecules become reduced, then instantly the
    body will expand under the heat which it possesses, and of course a
    portion of the heat will be consumed in expansion, and a cooling effect
    will result. Now tension, although it does not actually lessen the
    cohesive force of the molecules of the stretched body, yet produces, by
    counteracting this force, the same effect; for it allows the molecules
    an opportunity of performing work of expansion, and a cooling effect
    is the consequence. If the piston of a steam-engine, for example, be
    loaded to such an extent that the steam is unable to move it, the steam
    in the interior of the cylinder will not lose any of its heat; but if
    the piston be raised by some external force, the molecules of the steam
    will assist this force, and consequently will suffer loss of heat in
    proportion to the amount of work which they perform. The very same
    occurs when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span> tension is applied to a solid. Previous to the application
    of tension, the heat existing in the molecules is unable to produce
    any expansion against the force of cohesion. But when the influence of
    cohesion is partly counteracted by the tension applied, the heat then
    becomes enabled to perform work of expansion, and a cooling effect is
    the result.</p>

  <div class="center mb3">THE CAUSE OF REGELATION.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></div>

  <p>There are two theories which have been advanced to explain Regelation,
    the one by Professor Faraday, and the other by Professor James Thomson.</p>

  <p>According to Professor James Thomson, pressure is the cause of
    regelation. Pressure applied to ice tends to lower the melting-point,
    and thus to produce liquefaction; but the water which results is
    colder than the ice, and refreezes the moment it is relieved from
    pressure. When two pieces of ice are pressed together, a melting takes
    place at the points in contact, resulting from the lowering of the
    melting-point; the water formed, re-freezing, joins the two pieces
    together.</p>

  <p>The objection which has been urged against this theory is that
    regelation will take place under circumstances where it is difficult to
    conceive how pressure can be regarded as the cause. Two pieces of ice,
    for example, suspended by silken threads in an atmosphere above the
    melting-point, if but simply allowed to touch each other, will freeze
    together. Professor J. Thomson, however, attributes the freezing to
    the pressure resulting from the capillary attraction of the two moist
    surfaces in contact. But when we reflect that it requires the pressure
    of a mile of ice—135 tons on the square foot—to lower the melting-point
    one degree, it must be obvious that the lowering effect resulting
    from capillary attraction in the case under consideration must be
    infinitesimal indeed.</p>

  <p>The following clear and concise account of Faraday’s theory, I quote
    from Professor Tyndall’s “Forms of Water:”—</p>

  <p>“Faraday concluded that <em>in the interior</em> of any body, whether solid
    or liquid, where every particle is grasped, so to speak, by the
    surrounding particles, and grasps them in turn, the bond of cohesion
    is so strong as to require a higher temperature to change the state
    of aggregation than is necessary <em>at the surface</em>. At the surface of
    a piece of ice, for example, the molecules are free on one side from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>the control of other molecules; and they therefore yield to heat more
    readily than in the interior. The bubble of air or steam in overheated
    water also frees the molecules on one side; hence the ebullition
    consequent upon its introduction. Practically speaking, then, the
    point of liquefaction of the interior ice is higher than that of the
    superficial ice....</p>

  <p>“When the surfaces of two pieces of ice, covered with a film of the
    water of liquefaction, are brought together, the covering film is
    transferred from the surface to the centre of the ice, where the point
    of liquefaction, as before shown, is higher than at the surface.
    The special solidifying power of ice upon water is now brought
    into play <em>on both sides of the film</em>. Under these circumstances,
    Faraday held that the film would congeal, and freeze the two surfaces
    together.”—<cite>The Forms of Water</cite>, p. 173.</p>

  <p>The following appears to be a more simple explanation of the phenomena
    than either of the preceding:—</p>

  <p>The freezing-point of water, and the melting-point of ice, as Professor
    Tyndall remarks, touch each other as it were at this temperature. At
    a hair’s-breadth lower water freezes; at a hair’s-breadth higher ice
    melts. Now if we wish, for example, to freeze water, already just about
    the freezing-point, or to melt a piece of ice already just about the
    melting-point, we can do this either by a change of temperature or
    by a change of the melting-point. But it will be always much easier
    to effect this by the former than by the latter means. Take the
    case already referred to, of the two pieces of ice suspended in an
    atmosphere above the melting-point. The pieces at their surfaces are
    in a melting condition, and are surrounded by a thin film of water
    just an infinitesimal degree above the freezing-point. The film has on
    the one side solid ice at the freezing-point, and on the other a warm
    atmosphere considerably above the freezing-point. The tendency of the
    ice is to lower the temperature of the film, while that of the air is
    to raise its temperature. When the two pieces are brought into contact
    the two films unite and form one film separating the two pieces of ice.
    This film is not like the former in contact with ice on the one side
    and warm air on the other. It is surrounded on both sides by solid ice.
    The tendency of the ice, of course, is to lower the film to the same
    temperature as the ice itself, and thus to produce solidification.
    It is evident that the film must either melt the ice or the ice must
    freeze the film, if the two are to assume the same temperature. But the
    power of the ice to produce solidification, owing to its greater mass,
    is enormously greater than the power of the film to produce fluidity,
    consequently regelation is the result.</p>

  <p>Dr. Petermann has, in this memoir, by a different line of argument
    from that which I have pursued in this volume, shown in the most clear
    and convincing manner that the abnormally high temperature of the
    north-western shores of Europe and the seas around Spitzbergen is owing
    entirely to the Gulf-stream, and not to any general circulation such as
    that advocated by Dr. Carpenter. From a series of no fewer than 100,000
    observations of temperature in the North Atlantic and in the arctic

  <div class="center large">AND ITS RELATION TO THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN.</div>

  <div class="center mt2">By JAMES GEIKIE, F.R.S.E., F.G.S., &amp;c., of H.M. Geological Survey.</div>

  <p>“There is a great charm in the well-balanced union of cultivated powers
    of observation and analytical method, with considerable imagination
    and much poetical feeling, which runs through the pages of this
    volume.... We have indicated but imperfectly the philosophical spirit
    which marks every step of inquiry into the wonders of this ‘Great Ice
    Age,’ and we strongly recommend the volume to all who are prepared
    to read thoughtfully, and weigh the evidences of truth carefully,
    in the assurance of finding that there are indeed, ‘Sermons in
    Stones.’”—<cite>Athenæum.</cite></p>

  <p>“Every step in the process is traced with admirable perspicuity
    and fullness by Mr. Geikie.... This book will mark an epoch in the
    scientific study of the Ice Age.”—<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

  <p>“The book shows everywhere the marks of acute observation, wide
    research, and sound reasoning. It presents in a readable form the chief
    features of the great Ice Age, and illustrates them very amply from
    those great tracts of Scotland in which glaciation has left its most
    distinct and most enduring marks.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

  <p>“No one can peruse this most interesting book without feeling grateful
    to Mr. Geikie for his masterly summing-up of the evidence, and
    appreciating the spirit of scientific candour with which he states his
    conclusions. At once in respect of its matter and its tone, the work
    forms a valuable contribution to our scientific literature.”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

  <p>“By far the most important contribution to the chapter of Geological
    inquiry that has yet appeared. We can assure our readers that they
    will find in Mr. Geikie’s book an admirable and satisfactory summary
    of the present condition of opinion on some of the most interesting
    of geological questions which are here discussed in an agreeable and
    readable manner.”—<cite>Westminster Review.</cite></p>

  <p>“This work, without any sacrifice of scientific accuracy and
    completeness, is so clear, and so free from technicalities, as to be
    intelligible to any reader of ordinary education. For knowledge and
    command of his subject, for skill in the arrangement of his facts, and
    for the clearness with which he reasons out his conclusions, Mr. Geikie
    occupies a high place as a scientific writer.”—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

  <p>“The most comprehensive and lucid interpretation that has been given of
    the Great Ice Age.”—<cite>Edinburgh Courant.</cite></p>

  <p>“It offers to the student of geology by far the completest account of
    the period yet published, and is characterized throughout by refreshing
    vigour of diction and originality of thought.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

  <p>“Can be cordially recommended both to the geologist and the general
    reader. The explanations are so full, and the method of handling so
    free from technicality, that with a moderate amount of attention the
    book may be understood, and its reasoning followed, by those who had
    previously little or no geological knowledge.”—<cite>Nature.</cite></p>

        a trip to Rome and the South, to Central or Northern Italy,
        will find him a kind, genial, and entertaining companion, who
        will show them what to see, and how to see it. At any time,
        stay-at-home travellers will read the volume with interest,
        and the descriptions of the sins and shames of Rome—still

        to pursue any investigation of man’s history from the purely
        physical side. Its reasoning seems as absolutely conclusive
        against the upholders of the ‘natural selection’ theory. The
        book is worthy of a place in every library, as skilfully

        Coast Survey, and where also its velocity was greatest, was found to
        be over 30 statute miles broad and 1,950 feet deep. But we must not
        suppose that this represents all the warm water which is received by
        the Atlantic from the equator; a great mass flows into the Atlantic
        without passing through the Straits of Florida.

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> It is probable that a large proportion of the water
        constituting the south-eastern branch of the Gulf-stream is never
        cooled down to 40°; but, on the other hand, the north-eastern branch,
        which passes into the arctic regions, will be cooled far below 40°,
        probably below 30°. Hence I cannot be over-estimating the extent to
        which the water of the Gulf-stream is cooled down in fixing upon 40° as
        the average minimum temperature.

        p. 334) misapprehends me in supposing that I attribute the Gibraltar
        current wholly to the Gulf-stream. In the very page from which he
        derives or could derive his opinion as to my views on the subject
        (Phil. Mag. for March, 1874, p. 182), I distinctly state that
        “the excess of evaporation over that of precipitation within the
        Mediterranean area would of itself produce a considerable current
        through the Strait.” That the Gibraltar current is due to two causes,
        (1) the pressure of the Gulf-stream, and (2) excess of evaporation
        over precipitation in the Mediterranean, has always appeared to me so
        perfectly obvious, that I never held nor could have held any other opinion on the subject.

        says, with the heaps of gravel and sand in the lower grounds of Sweden
        and Norway, Scotland and Ireland. These deposits are evidently in the
        first place merely the materials carried down by the swollen rivers
        that issued from the gradually melting ice-fields and glaciers. The
        stones of the gravel derived from the demolition of moraines and till,
        have lost all their striæ and become in most cases well water-worn and
        rounded.

        is being lowered at the rate of one foot in 10,000 years by the removal
        of the sediment; and he proceeds further, and reasons that one foot
        removed off the general surface of the land during that period would
        raise the sea-level three inches. Had it not been that Mr. Tylor’s
        attention was directed to the effects produced by the removal of
        sediment in raising the level of the ocean rather than in lowering the
        level of the land, he could not have failed to perceive that he was in
        possession of a key to unfold the mystery of geological time.

        snowfall there is probably less than at lower latitudes. The fact is,
        however, overlooked, that the greater thickness of an ice-cap at its
        centre is a physical necessity not depending on the rate of snowfall.
        Supposing the snowfall to be greater at, say, lat. 70° than at 80°, and
        greater at 80° than at the pole; nevertheless, the ice will continue to
        accumulate till it is thicker at 80° than at 70°, and at the pole than
        it is at 80°.

        Geology”) and also Mr. Belt (Quart. Journ. of Science, October, 1874)
        state that Leverrier has lately investigated the question as to the
        extent of the variation of the plane of the ecliptic, and has arrived
        at results differing considerably from those of Laplace; viz., that
        the variation may amount to 4° 52′, whereas, according to Laplace,
        it amounts to only 1° 21′. I fear they are comparing things that are
        totally different; viz., the variation of the plane of the ecliptic
        in relation to its mean position with its variation in relation to
        the equator. Laplace estimated that the plane of the ecliptic would
        oscillate to the extent of 4° 53′ 33″ on each side of its mean
        position, a result almost identical with that of Leverrier, who makes
        it 4° 51′ 42″. But neither of these geometricians ever imagined that
        the ecliptic could change in relation to the equator to even one-third of that amount.

      <p>
        Laplace demonstrated that the change in the plane of the ecliptic
        affected the position of the equator, causing it to vary along with it,
        so that the equator could never possibly recede further than 1° 22′
        34″ from its mean position in relation to the ecliptic (“<cite>Mécanique
        Céleste</cite>,” vol. ii., p. 856, Bowditch’s Translation; see also
        Laplace’s memoir, “Sur les Variations de l’Obliquité de l’Écliptique,”
        <cite>Connaissance des Temps</cite> for 1827, p. 234), and I am not aware that
        Leverrier has arrived at a different conclusion.</p>

        in relation to the aphelion, it will not do to assume, as is commonly

        any regular given period, such as 21,000 years; for it is perfectly
        evident that owing to the great irregularity in the motion of the
        aphelion, no two revolutions will probably be performed in the same
        length of period. For example, the winter solstice was in the aphelion
        about the following dates: 11,700, 33,300, and 61,300 years ago. Here
        are two consecutive revolutions, the one performed in 21,600 years and
        the other in 28,000 years; the difference in the length of the two
        periods amounting to no fewer than 6,400 years.

      <a id="Footnote_282" href="#FNanchor_282" class="label">[282]</a> Mr. Milne Home has advanced, in his “Estuary of the
        Firth of Forth,” p. 91, the theory that this trough had been scooped
        out during the glacial epoch by icebergs floating through the Midland
        valley from west to east when it was submerged. The bottom of the
        trough, be it observed, at the watershed at Kilsyth, is 300 feet
        above the level of its bottom at Grangemouth; and this Mr. Milne Home
        freely admits. But he has not explained how an iceberg, which could
        float across the shallow water at Kilsyth, say, 100 feet deep, could
        manage to grind the rocky bottom at Grangemouth, where it was not less
        than 400 feet deep. “The impetus acquired in the Kyle at Kilsyth,”
        says Mr. Milne Home, “would keep them moving on, and the prevailing
        westerly winds would also aid, so that when <i>grating</i> on the subjacent
        carboniferous rocks they would not have much difficulty in scooping out
        a channel both wider and deeper than at Kilsyth.” But how could they
        “<i>grate</i> on the subjacent carboniferous rocks” at Grangemouth, if they
        managed to <i>float</i> at Kilsyth? Surely an iceberg that could “<i>grate</i>”
        at Grangemouth would “<i>ground</i>” at Kilsyth.

      <a id="Footnote_284" href="#FNanchor_284" class="label">[284]</a> Mr. John Young and Mr. Milne Home advanced the
        objection, that several trap dykes cross the valley of the Clyde near
        Bowling, and come to so near the present surface of the land, that
        the Clyde at present flows across them with a depth not exceeding 20
        feet. I fear that Mr. Young and Mr. Milne Home have been misinformed in
        regard to the existence of these dykes. About a mile <i>above</i> Bowling
        there are one or two dykes which approach to the river-bank, and may
        probably cross, but these could not possibly cut off a channel entering
        the Clyde at Bowling. In none of the borings or excavations which have
        been made by the Clyde Trustees has the rock been reached from Bowling
        downwards. I may also state that the whole Midland valley, from the
        Forth of Clyde to the Firth of Forth, has been surveyed by the officers
        of the Geological Survey, and only a single dyke has been found to
        cross the buried channels, viz., one (Basalt rock) running eastward
        from Kilsyth to the canal bridge near Dullatur. But as this is not
        far from the watershed between the two channels it cannot affect the
        question at issue. See sheet 31 of Geological Survey Map of Scotland.

      <a id="Footnote_309" href="#FNanchor_309" class="label">[309]</a> There is one circumstance tending slightly to prevent
        the rupture of the glacier, when under tension, which I do not remember
        to have seen noticed; that is, the cooling effect which is produced
        in solids, such as ice, when subjected to tension. Tension would tend
        to lower the temperature of the ice-molecules, and this lowering of
        temperature would have the tendency of freezing them more firmly
        together. The cause of this cooling effect will be explained in the
        Appendix.

        nearly half a century previous to the appearance of this paper, and

        Lagrange’s results differ but slightly from those afterwards obtained
        by Leverrier, as will be seen from the following table; but as he
        had assigned erroneous values to the masses of the smaller planets,
        particularly that of Venus, the mass of which he estimated at one-half
        more than its true value, full confidence could not be placed in his
        results.

        below the freezing-point, and Herschel himself has lately determined
        271° below the freezing-point to be the temperature of space.
        Consequently, a decrease, or an increase of one per cent. in the mean
        annual amount of radiation would not produce anything like the effect
        which is here supposed. But the mean annual amount of heat received
        cannot vary much more than one-tenth part of one per cent. In short,
        the effect of eccentricity on the mean annual supply of heat received
        from the sun, in so far as geological climate is concerned, may be
        practically disregarded.—[J. C.]

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_318" href="#FNanchor_318" class="label">[318]</a> “Principles of Geology,” p. 110. “Mr. Lyell, however,
        in stating the actual excess of eight days in the duration of the
        sun’s presence in the northern hemisphere over that in the southern as
        productive of an excess of light and heat annually received by the one
        over the other hemisphere, appears to have misconceived the effect of
        elliptic motion in the passage here cited, since it is demonstrable
        that whatever be the ellipticity of the earth’s orbit the two
        hemispheres must receive equal absolute quantities of light and heat
        per annum, the proximity of the sun in perigee exactly compensating the
        effect of its swifter motion. This follows from a very simple theorem,
        which may be thus stated: ‘The amount of heat received by the earth
        from the sun while describing any part of its orbit is proportional to
        the angle described round the sun’s centre,’ so that if the orbit be
        divided into two portions by a line drawn <i>in any direction</i> through
        the sun’s centre, the heats received in describing the two unequal
        segments of the ellipse so produced will be equal.”

      <a id="Footnote_319" href="#FNanchor_319" class="label">[319]</a> When the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is at its
        superior limit, the absolute quantity of heat received by the globe
        during one year will be increased by only 1/300th part; an amount which
        could produce no sensible influence on climate.—[J. C.]

      <a id="Footnote_320" href="#FNanchor_320" class="label">[320]</a> Sir Charles has recently, to a certain extent, adopted
        the views advocated in the present volume, viz., that the cold of
        the glacial epoch was brought about not by a <i>decrease</i>, but by an
        <i>increase</i> of eccentricity. (See vol. i. of “Principles,” tenth and
        eleventh editions.) The decrease in the mean annual quantity of heat
        received from the sun, resulting from the decrease in the eccentricity
        of the earth’s orbit—the astronomical cause to which he here
        refers—could have produced no sensible effect on climate.—[J. C.]
